I’ve got joy down In my heart
Deep, deep, down in my heart
J-O-Y down in my heart
Deep, deep, down in my heart

Jesus gave it to me
Nothing can destroy it,
Destroy it... destroy it...
destroy it...
Ah! I’ve got joy down in my heart
Deep, deep, down in my heart
J-O-Y down in my heart
Deep, deep, down in my heart
