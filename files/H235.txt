 Onward, Christian Soldiers,
 Marching as to war,
 Looking unto Jesus,
 Who is gone before.
 Christ, the royal Master,
 Leads against the foe;
 Forward into battle,
 See, His banners go.

[C]
 Onward,Christian soldiers,
 Marching as to war,
 Looking unto Jesus,
 Who is gone before.

[V2]
 At the Name of Jesus
 Satan's host doth flee;
 On then, Christian soldiers,
 On to victory!
 Hell's foundations quiver
 At the shout of praise:
 Brothers, lift your voices:
 Loud your anthems raise.

[V3]
 Like a mighty army,
 Moves the church of God:
 Brothers, we are treading
 Where the saints have trod;
 We are not divided,
 All one body we,
 One in hope and doctrine,
 One in charity.

[V4]
 Crowns and thrones may perish,
 Kingdoms rise and wane;
 But the church of Jesus
 Constant will remain:
 Gates of hell can never
 `Gainst that Church prevail;
 We have Christ's own promise,
 And that cannot fail.

[V5]
 Onward, then, ye people,
 Join our happy throng;
 Blend with ours your voices
 In the triumph-song;
 Glory, praise and honour,
 Unto Christ the King;
 This through countless ages
 Men and angels sing.
