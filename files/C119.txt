 I will sing unto the Lord ,
 For He has triumphed gloriously,
 The horse and rider fell into the sea.  (repeat)

[V2]
 The Lord is God and I will praise Him;
 The Lord is God and I will exalt Him. (repeat)

[V3]
 I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously,
 The grave is empty won't you come and see.  (repeat)
