 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,
 But only that which is good to help your brother out.
 And be kind to one another, tender-hearted too;
 Forgiving one another as God has forgiven you .

[C]
 And grieve not the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God,
 But be ye therefore as dear children, followers of God.

[V2]
 Let all bitterness, wrath and anger too,
 Lies and evil speaking be put away from you,
 Have no filthiness, foolish talk or pranks,
 Which are not convenient but rather giving thanks.
