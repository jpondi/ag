 'Tis the grandest theme thro' the ages rung,
 'Tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue,
 'Tis the grandest theme that the world e'er sung,
 "Our God is able to deliver thee!"

[C]
 He is able to deliver thee
 He is able to deliver thee
 Tho' by sin opprest,
 Go to Him for rest:
 "Our God is able to deliver thee!"

[V2]
 `Tis the grandest theme heard on earth or main,
 `Tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain,
 `Tis the grandest theme, tell it out again,
 "Our God is able to deliver thee!"

[V3]
 'Tis the grandest theme, let the tidings roll
 To the guilty heart, to the weary soul;
 Look to God in faith, He will make thee whole:
 "Our God is able to deliver thee!"
