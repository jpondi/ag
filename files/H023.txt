 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
 In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
 Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
 Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.

[V2]
 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
 Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
 Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,
 Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

[V3]
 To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;
 In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
 We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
 And wither and perish, but naught changeth Thee.

[V4]
 Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,
 Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
 All laud we would render, oh, help us to see
 `Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee.

[V5]
 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
 In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
 Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
 Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise
