 I have tasted a freedom,
 I can go where He's leading,
 The shackles can hold me no more.
 I have learned of life's essence
 As I stand in His presence,
 And sing with my heart, He is Lord.

[C]
 Keep silent, ye mountains,
 Ye fields and ye fountains,
 For this is the time I must sing;
 It's the time to sing praises
 To the Rock of the Ages,
 And this is the time I must sing.

[V2]
 There are days filled with sorrow,
 And plans for tomorrow,
 But this is the time I must sing;
 And I know there's a reason
 Why in His own season
 God gives me a song I can sing.
