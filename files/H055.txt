 The God of Abraham praise,
 Who reigns enthroned above,
 Ancient of everlasting days,
 And God of love!
 Jehovah! Great I AM!
 By earth and heaven confessed,
 I bow and bless the sacred Name,
 Forever blest.

[V2]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 At whose supreme command
 From earth I rise, and seek the joys
 At His right hand.
 I all on earth forsake,
 Its wisdom, fame and power;
 And Him my only portion make,
 My Shield and Tower.

[V3]
 He by Himself hath sworn,
 I on His oath depend:
 I shall, on eagles' wings upborne,
 To heaven ascend.
 I shall behold His face,
 I shall His power adore,
 And sing the wonders of His grace
 Forever more.

[V4]
 There dwells the Lord our King,
 The Lord our righteousness,
 Triumphant o'er the world and sin:
 The Prince of Peace.
 On Zion's sacred height
 His kingdom still maintains,
 And glorious with His saints in light
 Forever reigns.

[V5]
 The whole triumphant host
 Give thanks to God on high;
 "Hail, Father, Son and Holy Ghost!"
 They ever cry.
 Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
 I join the heavenly lays;
 All might and majesty are Thine,
 And endless praise.
