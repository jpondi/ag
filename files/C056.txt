 Father God, I wonder how I managed to exist
 Without the knowledge of Your parenthood and Your loving care.
 But now I am Your son,
 I am adopted in Your family,
 And I can never be alone,
 'Cause Father God, You're there beside me.

[C]
 I will sing Your praises,
 I will sing Your praises,
 I will sing Your praises forever more. (Reprat)
