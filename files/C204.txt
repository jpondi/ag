 Not by chance I'm standing here; God created me (2)

[C]
 I am with You every day(3)
 saith Jesus Christ.

[V2]
 From all sins which oppressed me, He did set me free. (2)

[V3]
 Nowhere in this world I find, such a blessed hope. (2)

[V4]
 Therefore with these songs of joy, I show forth His praise. (2)
