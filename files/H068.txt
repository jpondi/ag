 When I saw the cleansing fountain,
 Open wide for all my sin,
 I obeyed the Spirit's calling
 When He said, "Wilt thou be clean?"

[C]
 I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
 Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
 Give Him glory, all ye people,
 For His blood can wash away each stain.

[V2]
 Though the way seems straight and narrow,
 All I claimed was swept away;
 My ambitions, plans and wishes
 At my feet in ashes lay.

[V3]
 Then God's fire upon the altar
 Of my heart was set a flame;
 I shall never cease to praise Him
 Glory, glory to His name!

[V4]
 Blessed be the name of Jesus!
 I'm so glad He took me in;
 He's forgiven my transgression,
 He has cleansed my heart from sin.

[V5]
 Glory, glory to the Father!
 Glory, glory to the Son!
 Glory, glory to the Spirit!
 Glory to the Three in One!
