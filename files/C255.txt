 There is a name I love to hear;
 I love to sing its worth;
 It sounds like music in my ear,
 The sweetest name on earth.

[C]
 Oh, how I love Jesus, (3)
 Because He first loved me!

[V2]
 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
 My great Redeemer's praise!
 The glories of my God and King,
 The triumphs of His Grace.
