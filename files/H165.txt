 Sinners Jesus will receive;
 Sound this word of grace to all
 Who the heavenly pathway leave,
 All who linger, all who fall!

[C]
 Sing it o'er...and o'er again; ...
 Christ receiveth sinful men;...
 Make the mess...age clear and plain:
 Christ receiveth sinful men.

[V2]
 Come: and He will give you rest;
 Trust Him: for His word is plain;
 He will take the sinfulest:
 Christ receiveth sinful men.

[V3]
 Now my heart condemns me not,
 Pure before the law I stand;
 He who cleansed me from all spot,
 Satisfied its last demand.

[V4]
 Christ receieveth sinful men,
 Even me with all my sin;
 Purged from every spot and stain,
 Heaven with Him I enter in.
