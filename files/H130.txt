 Come with thy sins to the fountain,
 Come with thy burden of grief;
 Bury them deep in its waters-
 There thou wilt find a relief.

[C]
 Haste thou away! Why wilt thou stay?
 Risk not thy soul on a moment's delay;
 Jesus is waiting to save thee,
 Mercy is pleading today!

[V2]
 Come as thou art to the fountain--
 Jesus is waiting for thee;
 What though thy sins be like crimson!
 White as the snow they shall be!

[V3]
 These are the words of the Saviour:
 They who repent and believe,
 They who are willing to trust Him,
 Life at His hands shall receive.

[V4]
 Come and be healed at the fountain
 List to the peace-speaking voice;
 Over a sinner returning,
 Now let the angels rejoice!
