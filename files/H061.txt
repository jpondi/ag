 We praise Thee O God! for the Son of Thy love,
 For Jesus who died, and is now gone above.

[C]
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
 Hallelujah! Amen;
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
 Revive us again.

[V2]
 We praise Thee, O God! for Thy spirit of light,
 Who has shown us our Saviour, and has scattered our night.

[V3]
 All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,
 Who has borne all our sins, and has cleansed ev'ry stain.

[V4]
 Revive us again; fill each heart with Thy love;
 May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.
