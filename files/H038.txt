 More love to Thee, O Christ, more love to thee;
 Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee;
 This is my earnest plea
 More love, O Christ to thee,
 More love to Thee,
 More love to Thee.

[V2]
 Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;
 Now thee alone I seek, give what is best;
 This all my prayer shall be
 More love, O Christ to Thee,
 More love to Thee,
 More love to Thee:

[V3]
 Let sorrow do its work, send grief and pain:
 Sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain,
 When they can sing with me
 More love, O Christ to Thee,
 More love to Thee,
 More love to Thee.

[V4]
 Then shall my latest breath whisper Thy praise;
 This be the parting cry my heart shall raise
 This still its prayer shall be
 More love, O Christ to Thee,
 More love to Thee,
 More love to Thee.
