 Happiness is to know the saviour,
 Living a life within His favour
 Having a change in my behaviour-
 Happiness is the Lord:

[V2]
 Happiness is a new creation-
 "Jesus and me" in close relation,
 Having a part in His salvation,
 Happiness is the Lord:
 Real joy is mine, no matter if tear drops start;
 I've found the secret -it's Jesus in my heart!

[V3]
 Happiness is to be forgiven,
 Living a life that's worth the living,
 Taking a trip that leads to heaven---
 Happiness is the Lord:
 Happiness is the Lord, Happiness is the Lord!
