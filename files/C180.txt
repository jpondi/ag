 Living for eternity how hard it seems
 To souls bound by sin and compromise
 Yet one true wave of love from my Saviour's Cross
 Switches gears for me, turns me around.

[C]
 Oh! The love of the Cross
 Ushering in the crucified life
 My ugly self is buried;
 Crucified forever
 Life begins for me; as I live for eternity.

[V2]
 Things of the world and fleshly lusts
 Distract no more,
 No longer their lure deflects my soul;
 Jesus' love this matchless everlasting love
 Burns into my heart eternal goals.

[V3]
 Eternity's timelessness how awfully near,
 Relentlessly cutting me to size;
 Bone-chilling, unmasking all Earth's vanities
 Peace is mine while awaiting Etern'ty.
