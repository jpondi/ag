1.  A charge to keep I have,
    A God to glorify;
    A Neverdying soul to save,
    And fit it for the sky.

2.  To serve the present age,
    My calling to fulfil,
    O may it all my pow'rs engage,
    To do my Master's will

3.  Arm me with jealous care,
    As in Thy sight to live;
    And O, Thy servant, Lord, prepare
    A strict account to give.

4.  Help me to watch and pray,
    And on Thyself rely,
    Assured, if I my trust betray,
    I shall forever die.
