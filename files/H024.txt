 Jesus Lover of my soul,
 Let me to Thy bosom fly,
 While the nearer waters roll,
 While the tempest still is high:
 Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
 Till the storm of life be past,
 Safe into the haven guide,
 Oh, receive my soul at last!

[V2]
 Other refuge have I none,
 Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
 Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
 Still support and comfort me.
 All my trust on Thee is stayed,
 All my help from Thee I bring
 Cover my defenceless head
 With the shadow of Thy wing.

[V3]
 Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
 More than all in Thee I find:
 Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
 Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
 Just and holy is Thy Name,
 I am all unrighteousness;
 Vile, and full of sin I am,
 Thou art full of truth and grace.

[V4]
 Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
 Grace to pardon all my sin;
 Let the healing streams abound
 Make and keep me pure within.
 Thou of life the fountain art;
 Freely let me take of Thee,
 Spring Thou up within my heart,
 Rise to all eternity.
