 When I survey the wondrous Cross
 On which the Prince of glory died,
 My richest gain I count but loss,
 And pour contempt on all my pride.

[V2]
 Forbid it Lord, that I should boast,
 Save in the Cross of Christ my God:
 All the vain things that charm me most,
 I sacrifice them to His blood.

[V3]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 That were an offering far too small;
 Love so amazing, so divine,
 Demands my soul, my life, my all!
