 Is your life a channel of blessing?
 Is the love of God flowing through you?
 Are you telling the lost of the Saviour?
 Are you ready His service to do?

[C]
 Make me a channel of blessing today,
 Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
 My life possessing, my service blessing,
 Make me a channel of blessing today.

[V2]
 Is your life a channel of blessing?
 Are you burdened for those that are lost?
 Have you urged upon those who are straying
 The Saviour who died on the cross?

[V3]
 Is your life a channel of blessing?
 Is it daily telling for Him?
 Have you spoken the word of salvation
 To those who are dying in sin?

[V4]
 We cannot be channels of blessing
 If our lives are not free from known sin;
 We will barriers be and a hindrance
 To those we are trying to win.
