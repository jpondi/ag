 In the very thought of Jesus
 His presence can be found
 He's as close as the mention of His Name;
 There is never any distance
 Between my Lord and me
 He's as close as the mention of His Name

[C]
 He's as close as the mention of His name
 Jesus, Jesus. (2)

[V2]
 In my hour of struggle so many times I've found,
 He's as close as the mention of His Name;
 Just to breathe the name of Jesus
 Will turn everything around,
 He's as close as the mention of His Name.
