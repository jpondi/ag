 I hear Thy welcome voice,
 That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
 For cleansing in Thy precious blood
 That flowed on Calvary.

[C]
 I am coming, Lord,
 Coming now to Thee;
 Wash me, cleanse me,
 in the blood
 That flowed on Calvary.

[V2]
 `Tis Jesus calls me on
 To perfect faith and love,
 To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
 For earth and heaven above.

[V3]
 `Tis Jesus who confirms
 The blessed work within,
 By adding grace to welcomed grace,
 Where reigned the power of sin.

[V4]
 And He the witness gives
 To loyal hearts and free,
 That every promise is fulfilled,
 If faith but brings the plea.

[V5]
 All hail, atoning blood!
 All hail, redeeming grace!
 All hail, the gift of Christ, our Lord.
 Our Strength and Righteousness!
