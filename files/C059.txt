 Fear not, Rejoice and be glad,
 The Lord hath done a great thing;
 Hath poured out His Spirit on all manking
 On those who confess His name.

[V1]
 The fig tree is budding, the vine beareth fruit,
 The wheat fields are golden with grain
 Thrust in the sickle, the harvest is ripe
 The Lord has given us rain.

[V2]
 Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
 The mountains will drip with sweet wine.
 My children shall drink of the fountain of life,
 My children will know they are Mine.

[V3]
 My people shall know that I am the Lord,
 Their shame I have taken away.
 My Spirit will lead them together again,
 My Spirit will show them the way.

[V4]
 My children shall dwell in a Body of love,
 A light to the world they will be.
 Life shall come forth from the Father above,
 My Body will set mankind free.
