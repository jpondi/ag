 Mighty in vict'ry
 Glorious in majesty
 Every eye shall see Him---
 When He appears
 Coming in the clouds with
 power and glory
 Hail to the King!
 We must be ready ---
 watching and praying
 Serving each other ---
 building His Kingdom
 Then every knee shall bow,
 Then every tongue confess,
 Jesus is Lord!
