 Now thank we all our God,
 With hearts, and hands, and voices,
 Who wondrous things hath done,
 In whom His world rejoices;
 Who, from our mother's arms
 Hath blessed us on our way
 With countless gifts of love,
 And still is ours today.

[V2]
 Oh, may this bounteous God
 Through all our life be near us,
 With ever-joyful hearts
 And blessed peace to cheer us;
 And keep us in His grace,
 And guide us when perplexed,
 And free us from all ills
 In this world and the next.

[V3]
 All praise and thanks to God
 The father now be given,
 The Son, and Him who reigns
 With them in highest heaven;
 The one eternal God,
 Whom heaven and earth adore;
 For thus it was, is now,
 And shall be evermore.
