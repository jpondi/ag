 I will sing the wondrous story
 Of the Christ who died for me;
 How He left His home in glory
 For the cross on Calvary.

[C]
 Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
 Of the Christ who died for me;
 Sing it with the saints in glory,
 Gathered by the crystal sea.

[V2]
 I was lost: but Jesus found me---
 Found the sheep that went astray;
 Threw His loving arms around me,
 Drew me back into His way.

[V3]
 I was bruised: but Jesus healed me--
 Faint was I from many a fall;
 Sight was gone, and fears possessed me:
 But He freed me from them all.

[V4]
 Days of darkness still come o'er me;
 Sorrow's paths I often tread:
 But the Saviour still is with me,
 By His hand I'm safely led.

[V5]
 He will keep me till the river
 Rolls its waters at my feet:
 Then He'll bear me safely over,
 Where the loved ones I shall meet.
