 There will never be a sweeter story,
 Story of the Saviour's love divine,
 Love that brought Him from the realms of glory
 Just to save a sinful soul like mine.

[C]
 Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,
 O, isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful,
 Wonderful it is to me.

[V2]
 Boundless as the universe around me,
 Reaching to the farthest soul away,
 Saving, keeping love it was that found me,
 That is why my heart can truly say:

[V3]
 Love beyond all human comprehending,
 Love of God in Christ how can it be,
 This will be my theme and never ending,
 Great redeeming love of Calvary.
