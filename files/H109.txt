 Christ the Lord is risen today; Hallelujah!
 Sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah!
 Raise your joys and triumphs high; Hallelujah!
 Sing, ye heavens; thou earth, reply, Hallelujah!

[V2]
 Love's redeeming work is done;
 Fought the fight, the battle won:
 Lo! our Sun's eclipse is o'er;
 Lo! He sets in blood no more.

[V3]
 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,
 Christ hath burst the gates of hell:
 Death in vain forbids Him rise!
 Christ hath opened paradise.

[V4]
 Lives again our glorious King!
 Where, O death, is now thy sting?
 Once He died our souls to save;
 Where thy victory, O grave?

[V5]
 Soar we now where Christ hath led,
 Following our exalted Head:
 Made like Him, like Him we rise,
 Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.

[V6]
 Hail the Lord of earth and heaven,
 Praise to Thee by both be given;
 Thee we greet triumphant now,
 Hail, the Resurrection Thou!
