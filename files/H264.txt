 Soldiers of Christ, arise,
 And put your armour on,
 Strong in the strength which God supplies
 Through His eternal Son:

[V2]
 Strong in the Lord of hosts,
 And in His mighty power;
 Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
 Is more than conqueror.

[V3]
 Stand then in His great might,
 With all His strength endued;
 And take, to arm you for the fight,
 The panoply of God.

[V4]
 From strength to strength go on,
 Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
 Tread all the powers of darkness down,
 And win the well-fought day:

[V5]
 That, having all things done,
 And all your conflicts past,
 Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone
 And stand complete at last.
