 We want to see Jesus lifted high,
 A banner that flies across this land.
 That all men might see the truth and know.
 He is the way to heaven.

[C]
 We want to see (3)
 Jesus lifted high. (twice)

[V2]
 Step by step we're moving forward
 Little by little taking ground
 Every prayer a powerful weapon
 Strongholds come tumbling
 Down and down and down and down!
