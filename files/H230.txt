 I can hear my Saviour calling,
 I can hear my Saviour calling,
 I can hear my Saviour calling,
 "Take thy cross and follow, follow Me."

[C]
 Where He leads me I will follow,
 Where He leads me I will follow,
 Where He leads me I will follow,
 I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

[V2]
 I'll go with Him through the garden,
 I'll go with Him through the garden,
 I'll go with Him through the garden,
 I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

[V3]
 I'll go with Him through the judgement,
 I'll go with Him through the judgement,
 I'll go with Him through the judgement,
 I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

[V4]
 He will give me grace and glory,
 He will give me grace and glory,
 He will give me grace and glory,
 And go with me, with me all the way.
