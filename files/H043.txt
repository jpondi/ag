 O could I speak the matchless worth,
 O could I sound the glories forth
 Which in my Saviour shine,
 I'd soar and touch the heav'nly strings,
 And vie with Gabriel while he sings
 In notes almost divine, In notes almost divine.

[V2]
 I'd sing the precious blood He spilt
 My ransom from the dreadful guilt
 Of sin and wrath divine!
 I'd sing His glorious righteousness
 In which all perfect heavenly dress
 My soul shall ever shine, My soul shall ever shine.

[V3]
 I'd sing the characters He bears,
 And all the forms of love He wears,
 Exalted on His throne.
 In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
 I would to everlasting days
 Make all His glories known, Make all His glories known.

[V4]
 Soon, the delightful day will come
 When my dear Lord will bring me home,
 And I shall see His face;
 Then with my Saviour, Brother, Friend,
 A blest eterinity I'll spend,
 Triumphant in His grace, Triumphant in His grace.
