 Greater is He that is in me (3)
 Than he that is in the world
 Satan's like a roaring lion
 Roaming to and fro
 Seeking whom he may devour
 The Bible tells me so
 Many souls have been deceived
 To fall in some weak hour
 But God has promised us today
 His overcoming power.
 Greater is He . . .
