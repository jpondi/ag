 Nothing between, Lord,
 Nothing between;
 Let me Thy glory see,
 Draw my soul close to Thee;
 Then speak in love to me
 Nothing between.

[V2]
 Nothing between, Lord,
 Nothing between;
 Let not earth's din and noise
 Stifle Thy still small voice;
 In it let me rejoice
 Nothing between.

[V3]
 Nothing between, Lord,
 Nothing between;
 Unbelief disappear,
 Vanish each doubt and fear,
 Fading when Thou art near
 Nothing between.

[V4]
 Nothing between, Lord,
 Nothing between;
 Till Thine eternal light,
 Rising on earth's dark night,
 Bursts on my open sight
 Nothing between.
