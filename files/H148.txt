 I have a song that Jesus gave me,
 It was sent from heav'n above;
 There never was a sweeter melody,
 `Tis a melody of love.

[C]
 In my heart there rings a melody,
 There rings a melody with heavenly harmony;
 In my heart there rings a melody;
 There rings a melody of love.

[V2]
 I love the Christ who died on Calv'ry,
 For He washed my sins away;
 He put within my heart a melody,
 And I know it's there to stay.

[V3]
 `Twill be my endless theme in glory,
 With the angels I will sing;
 `Twill be a song with glorious harmony,
 When the courts of heaven ring.
