 Jesus, what a beautiful name!
 Son of God, Son of man
 Lamb that was slain
 Joy and peace, strength and hope
 Grace that blows all fear away
 Jesus, what a beautiful name!

[V2]
 Jesus what a beautiful name!
 Truth revealed, my future sealed
 Healed my pain
 Love and freedom, life and warmth
 Grace that blows all fear away
 Jesus, what a beautiful name!

[V3]
 Jesus, what a beautiful name!
 Rescued my soul, my strong hold
 Lift me from shame
 Forgiveness security, power and love
 Grace that blows all fear away
 Jesus, what a beautiful name!
