1.  The Lord's our Rock,
    in Him we hide,
    A Shelter in the time of storm;
    Secure whatever ill betide,
    A Shelter in the time of storm.

        Oh, Jesus is a Rock
        in a weary land,
        A weary land, a weary land;
        Oh, Jesus is a Rock
        in a weary land,
        A Shelter in the time of storm.

2.  A shade by day,
    defense by night,
    A Shelter in the time of storm;
    No fears alarm, no foes afright,
    A Shelter in the time of storm.

3.  The raging storms
    may round us beat
    A Shelter in the time of storm
    We'll never leave
    our safe retreat,
    A Shelter in the time of storm.

4.  O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
    A Shelter in the time of storm;
    Be Thou our Helper ever near,
    A Shelter in the time of storm.
