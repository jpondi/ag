 These are the days of Elijah
 Declaring the Word of the Lord
 And these are the days of Your servant Moses',
 Righteousness being restored
 And though these are days of great trials
 Of famine and darkness and sword
 Still we are the voice in the desert crying
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord.

[C]
 Behold He comes riding on the clouds
 Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
 So lift your voice it's the year of Jubilee
 And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

[V2]
 And these are the days of Ezekiel
 The dry bones becoming as flesh
 And these are the days of your servant David
 Rebuilding the temple of praise
 And these are the days of the harvest
 The fields are white in the world
 And we are Your labourers in Your vineyard
 Declaring the Word of the Lord.
