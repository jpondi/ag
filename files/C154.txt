 Jesus is a wonderful Saviour,
 He will carry you thru; (3)
 Until the battle's done and the victory is won my Lord will carry you thru;
 O, my precious brother, when the world's on fire,
 You'll need my Jesus to be your Saviour;
 He'll hide you ever in the Rock of Ages,
 In the Rock of Ages just cleft for you.
