 The voice that breathed o'er Eden,
 That earliest wedding day,
 The primal marriage blessing,
 It hath not pass'd away.

[V2]
 Still in the pure espousal
 Of christian man and maid
 The Holy Three are with us,
 The threefold grace is said.

[V3]
 For dower of bless'd children,
 For love and faith's sweet sake,
 For high mysterious union,
 Which nought on earth may break.

[V4]
 Be present, awful Father,
 To give away this bride,
 As Eve Thou gav'st to Adam,
 Out of his own pierced side.

[V5]
 Be present, Son of Mary,
 To join their loving hands,
 As Thou didst bind two natures
 In Thine Eternal bands.

[V6]
 Be present, Holiest Spirit,
 To bless them as they kneel,
 As Thou for Christ, the Bridegroom,
 The heavenly spouse does seal.

[V7]
 O spread Thy pure wings o'er them,
 Let no ill power find place,
 When onward to Thine Altar
 The hallow'd path they trace.

[V8]
 To cast their crowns before Thee
 In perfect sacrifice,
 Till to the home of gladness
 With Christ's own Bride they rise.
