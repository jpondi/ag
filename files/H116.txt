 Oh, now I see the cleansing wave!
 The fountain deep and wide;
 Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
 Points to His wounded side.

[C]
 The cleansing stream I see, I see!
 I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me!
 Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me.
 It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

[V2]
 I see the new creation rise;
 I hear the speaking blood!
 It speaks! polluted nature dies!
 Sinks `neath the cleansing flood.

[V3]
 I rise to walk in heaven's own light,
 Above the world and sin,
 With heart made pure, and garments white,
 And Christ enthroned within.

[V4]
 Amazing grace! `tis heav'n below
 To feel the blood applied
 And Jesus, only Jesus, know
 My Jesus crucified.
