 Crown Him with many crowns,
 The Lamb upon His throne;
 Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
 All music but its own:
 Awake, my soul and sing
 Of Him who died for thee,
 And hail Him as thy matchless King
 Through all eternity.

[V2]
 Crown Him the Lord of life,
 Who triumphed o'er the grave,
 And rose victorious in the strife
 For those He came to save:
 His glories now we sing
 Who died, and rose on high;
 Who died eternal life to bring,
 And lives that death may die.

[V3]
 Crown Him the Lord of love;
 Behold His hands and side,
 Those wounds yet visible above
 In beauty glorified:
 No angel in the sky
 Can fully bear that sight,
 But downward bends His burning eye
 At mysteries so bright.

[V4]
 Crown Him the Lord of peace,
 Whose power a sceptre sways,
 From pole to pole that wars may cease,
 And all be prayer and praise;
 His reign shall know no end,
 And round His pierced feet
 Fair flowers of Paradise extend
 Their fragrance ever sweet.

[V5]
 Crown Him the Lord of years,
 The Potentate of time,
 Creator of the rolling spheres,
 Ineffably sublime!
 All hail, Redeemer, hail!
 For Thou hast died for me;
 Thy praise shall never, never fail
 Throughout eternity.
