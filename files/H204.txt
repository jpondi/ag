 Fully surrendered, Lord divine,
 I will be true to Thee;
 All that I am or have is Thine,
 I will be true to Thee.

[C]
 I will be true to Thee, Lord;
 I will be true to Thee;
 Where Thou leadest me, I will follow Thee,
 I will be true to Thee.

[V2]
 Tho' it may cost me friends and home,
 I will be true to Thee;
 Cause me in lands afar to roam,
 I will be true to Thee.

[V3]
 Now to the world I bid farewell,
 I will be true to Thee;
 Broken for ever its deep spell,
 I will be true to Thee.

[V4]
 I will go with Thee all the way,
 I will be true to Thee;
 All of Thy bidding will obey,
 I will be true to Thee.
