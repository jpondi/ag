 Jesus bids us shine
 With a pure, clear light;
 Like a little candle
 Burning in the night--
 In this world of darkness,
 So we must shine--
 You in your small corner,
 And I in mine.

[V2]
 Jesus bids us shine,
 First of all for Him;
 Well He sees and knows it
 If our light grows dim.
 He looks down from heaven
 To see us shine--
 You in your small corner,
 And I in mine.

[V3]
 Jesus bids us shine
 Then, for all around;
 Many kinds of darkness
 In this world abound---
 Sin and want and sorrow;
 So we must shine---
 You in your small corner,
 And Iin mine.
