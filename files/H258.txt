 Faith of our fathers! living still
 In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
 O how our hearts beat high with joy
 Whene'er we hear that glorious Word!
 Faith of our fathers! holy faith!
 We will be true to Thee till death!

[V2]
 Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
 Were still in heart and conscience free:
 How sweet would be their children's fate,
 If they, like them, could die for Thee!
 Faith of our fathers! holy faith!
 We will be true to Thee till death!

[V3]
 Faith of our fathers! we will love
 Both friend and foe in all our strife:
 And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
 By kindly words and virtuous life:
 Faith of our fathers! holy faith!
 We will be true to Thee till death!
