 We've got a great big wonderful God (2)
 A God who's always victorious,
 Always watching over us
 Great big wonderful God.
 We've got a great big wonderful God (2)
 A God who loves ev'ry one of us
 Done so much for all of us,
 Great big wonderful God.
 He never, never, never leaves us,
 He's always standing by,
 To pick us up if we stumble,
 We're the apple of His eye.
 We've got a great big wonderful God (2)
 Oh what a glory it is to sing
 Praises to the coming King
 Great big wonderful God-
 A Great Big wonderful God.
