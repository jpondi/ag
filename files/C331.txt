I can see that you love Jesus first
It's plain to me
And that you sit so close
And hear His heartbeat
For in your eyes I see shinning
love
That speaks so clear
And I can hear them saying
So sweetly

He is lovely, He is holy
Gave supremely,
That all men might see
He is gentle, tender-hearted
Risen Savior, He is God

Master Maker, Life Creator, come
And dwell in me
That my heart may know
Your tender mercy
Shine through me that all may
see Your love
So full and free
And I'll declare Your praise
Through endless ages

You are lovely, You are holy
Gave supremely,
That all men might see
You are gentle, tender-hearted
Risen Savior, You are God
