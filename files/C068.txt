 Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning---
 Give me oil in my lamp, I pray;
 Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning---
 Keep me burning till the break of day

[C]
 Sing Hosanna, sing Hosanna,
 Sing Hosanna to the King of Kings;
 Sing Hosanna, Sing Hosanna,
 Sing Hosanna to the King.

[V2]
 Make me a fisher of men Keep me seeking,
 Make me a fisher of men, I pray,
 Make me a fisher of men, Keep me seeking,
 Seeking souls till Jesus comes again.
