 I want to be like Jesus,
 So lowly and so meek,
 For no one marked an angry word
 That ever heard Him speak:
 I want to be like Jesus,
 So frequently in prayer;
 Alone upon the mountain top
 He met His Father there.

[V2]
 I want to be like Jesus:
 I never, never find
 That He, though persecuted, was
 To anyone unkind:
 I want to be like Jesus,
 Engaged in doing good,
 So that of me it may be said,
 "She hath done what she could."

[V3]
 I want to be like Jesus,
 Who kindly said to all,
 "Let little children come to Me;"
 I would obey the call:
 But oh! I'm not like Jesus,
 As anyone may see;
 O gentle Saviour, send Thy grace,
 And make me like to Thee!
