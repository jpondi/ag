Give thanks to the Lord
Our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all
things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise

With a mighty hand and
outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever

Sing praise [x4]

Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever and ever, forever

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
By the grace of God 
we will carry on
His love endures forever

Sing praise [x4]
