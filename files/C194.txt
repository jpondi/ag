 And I will worship You with all of my heart,
 And I will worship You with all of my mind,
 And I will worship You with all of my strength,
 For Your are my Lord! You are my God.
 
[C]
 More love, more power,
 More of You in my life,
 More love, more power,
 More of You in my life.
 
[V2]
 And I will seek Your face with all of my heart,
 And I will seek Your face with all of my mind,
 And I will seek Your face with all of my strength,
 For You are my Lord! You are my God.
