 Without faith it's impossible, it's impossible, it's impossible to please God.
 He who comes to God must believe that He is
 And He rewards those who seek Him.
 All things are possible, all things are possible, all things are possible, just believe;
 God will do ev'ry thing that He says He will do, and He rewards those who seek Him.
