Great is Your faithfulness, oh God (AR24.12)
You wrestle with the sinner's heart
You lead us by still waters and to mercy
And nothing can keep us apart
So remember Your people
Remember Your children


Remember Your promise, oh God
Your grace is enough (2)
Your grace is enough for me
Great is Your love and justice, God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of Your salvation
And all Your people sing along

Supplement 2024 Song 12
