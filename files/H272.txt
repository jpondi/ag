 Nearer my God to Thee,
 Nearer to Thee;
 E'en though it be a cross
 That raiseth me;
 Still all my song shall be---
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
 Nearer to Thee.

[V2]
 Though, like the wanderer,
 The sun gone down,
 Darkness comes over me,
 My rest a stone:
 Yet in my dreams I'd be
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
 Nearer to Thee.

[V3]
 There let my way appear
 Steps unto heaven;
 All that Thou sendest me
 In mercy given;
 Angels to beckon me
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
 Nearer to Thee.

[V4]
 Then, with my waking thoughts
 Bright with Thy praise,
 Out of my stony griefs
 Bethel I'll raise;
 So by my woes to be
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
 Nearer to Thee.

[V5]
 Or if on joyful wing,
 Cleaving the sky,
 Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
 Upward I fly;
 Still all my song shall be,
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
 Nearer to Thee.
