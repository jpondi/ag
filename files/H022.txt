 I'm pressing on the upward way,
 New heights I'm gaining ev'ry day;
 Still praying as I'm onward bound,
 "Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

[C]
 Lord, lift me up, and let me stand,
 By faith, on heaven's tableland,
 A higher plane than I have found;
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground

[V2]
 My heart has no desire to stay
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
 Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
 My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

[V3]
 I want to live above the world,
 Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;
 For faith has caught the joyful sound,
 The song of saints on higher ground.

[V4]
 I want to scale the utmost height,
 And catch a gleam of glory bright;
 But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,
 "Lord, lead me on to higher ground."
