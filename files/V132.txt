If you're on your way to heaven, 
clap your hands,
If you're sins have been forgiven, 
clap your hands, 
Point to heaven in the sky 
Then shake hands with one near by 
It you're happy all the while, 
clap your hands,
Clap your hands (2)
If you're glad that you're a Christian, 
clap your hands. 

If you're not ashamed of Jesus, 
raise your hand,
If you've taken your stand for Jesus, 
take your stand
Now sit down and rest a while Turn to someone with a smile If the Lord can satisfy, clap your hands 
Clap your hands (2)
If youâ€™re glad that you're a Christian, 
clap your hands.
