 I am thinking today of that beautiful land
 I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
 When thro' wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand,
 Will there be any stars in my crown?

[C]
 Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
 When at ev'ning the sun goeth down?...;
 When I wake with the blest In the mansions of rest,
 Will there be any stars in my crown?...;

[V2]
 In the strength of the Lord let me labour and pray,
 Let me watch as a winner of souls,
 That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
 When His praise like the sea billow rolls.

[V3]
 Oh, what joy will it be when His face I behold,
 Living gems at His feet to lay down;
 It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold,
 Should there be any stars in my crown.
