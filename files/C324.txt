    Bless the Lord oh my soul
    Oh my soul
    Worship His Holy name
    Sing like never before
    Oh my soul
    I'Il worship Your Holy name

1.  The sun comes up
    It's a new day dawning
    It's time to sing Your song again
    Whatever may pass
    And whatever lies before me
    Let me be singing
    When the evening comes

2.  You're rich in love
    And You're slow to anger
    Your name is great
    And Your heart is kind
    For all Your goodness
    I will keep on singing
    Ten thousand reasons
    For my heart to find

3.  And on that day
    When my strength is failing
    The end draws near
    And my time has come
    Still my soul will
    Sing Your praise unending
    Ten thousand years
    And then forevermore
