 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way!
 Thou art the potter; I am the clay!
 Mould me and make me after Thy will,
 While I am waiting, yielded and still.

[V2]
 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way!
 Search me and try me, Master, today!
 Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
 As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

[V3]
 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way!
 Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
 Power,all power, surely is Thine!
 Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine!

[V4]
 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way!
 Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
 Filled with Thy Spirit till all shall see
 Christ only, always, living in me!
