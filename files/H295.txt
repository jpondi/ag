1.  Brightly beams our Father's
    mercy
    From His light house ever more;
    But to us He gives the keep-ing
    Of the lights a-long the shore
    
        Let the lower lights be burning!
        Send a gleam across the wavel
        Some poor fainting, struggling
        sea-man
        You may rescue, you may save
        
2.  Dark the night of sin has settled,
    Loud the angry billows roar:
    Eager eyes are watching, longing,
    For the lights a long the shore,
    
3.  Trim your feeble lamp,
    my brother!
    Some poor seaman,
    tempest tossed,
    Trying now to make the harbor,
    In the darkness may be lost.
