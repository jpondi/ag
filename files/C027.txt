 Blessed are the pure in heart,
 For they shall see God. (2)

[V1]
 To see God, the Alpha and Omega.
 To see God, Creator, life-sustainer.
 To see God, To think that this is possibility.

[V2]
 To see God, The everlasting father,
 To see God, Whose love endures Forever.
 To see God, how wonderful to think that this could be.

[V3]
 To see God, the God who talked with Moses.
 To see God, Whose mercies are so endless
 To see God, what better incentive for purity

[V4]
 To see God, The one I've loved and longed for.
 To see God, the Father of my Saviour
 To see God a dream come true at last His face I'll see.
