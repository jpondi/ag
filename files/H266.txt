 When the Lord shall come upon us
 And His glory we shall see
 Sense and know His power within us
 Feel His perfect liberty
 When the Lord our love possesses
 And His love pervades the whole
 How we easily surrender
 Oh how Jesus fills the soul.

[V2]
 When He has our every portion
 And His blood has touched the heart
 Cleansed _ we gaze and gaze upon Him
 Can it be! My Lord, my God!
 How I love Him! Oh I love Him!
 How I clasp that matchless Name!
 Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
 King of kings! To me He came!

[V3]
 Oh I bend in adoration
 Jesus Thou dost flood my soul!
 Jesus fills the very heavens,
 He the way, the Life, the Goal,
 He the Saviour, His the glory!
 Mortals worship; angels, all!
 Jesus, Jesus only Jesus!
 While eternal ages roll.
