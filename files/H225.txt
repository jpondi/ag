 Oh, for a closer walk with God,
 A calm and heavenly frame
 A light to shine upon the road
 That leads me to the Lamb!

[V2]
 Where is the blessedness I knew
 When first I saw the Lord?
 Where is the soul-refreshing view
 Of Jesus and His Word?

[V3]
 What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
 How sweet their memory still!
 But they have left an aching void
 The world can never fill.

[V4]
 The dearest idol I have known,
 Whate'er that idol be,
 Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
 And worship only Thee.

[V5]
 So shall my walk be close with God,
 Calm and serene my frame:
 So purer light shall mark the road
 That leads me to the Lamb.
