 A mighty fortress is our God,
 A bulwark never failing;
 Our Helper He, amid the flood
 Of mortal ills prevailing.
 
[V2]
 For still our ancient foe
 Doth seek to work his woe;
 His craft and power are great,
 And armed with cruel hate--
 On earth is not his equal.
 
[V3]
 Did we in our own strength confide,
 Our striving would be losing;
 Were not the right Man on our side,
 The Man of God's own choosing.
 
[V4]
 Doth ask who that may be?
 Christ Jesus it is He!
 Lord Sabaoth is His Name,
 From age to age the same;
 And He must win the battle.
 
[V5]
 And though this world, with devils filled,
 Should threaten to undo us,
 We will not fear, for God hath willed
 His truth to triumph through us.
 
[V6]
 Let goods and kindred go,
 This mortal life also;
 The body they may kill,
 God's truth abideth still,
 His kingdom is for ever.
