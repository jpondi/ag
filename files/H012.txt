 Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
 Forgive our foolish ways;
 Reclothe us in our rightful mind;
 In purer lives Thy service find,
 In deeper reverence, praise.

[V2]
 In simple trust like theirs who heard
 Beside the Syrian sea,
 The gracious calling of the Lord,
 Let us, like them, without a word
 Rise up and follow Thee.

[V3]
 Oh, Sabbath rest by Galilee!
 Oh, calm of hills above,
 Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
 The silence of eternity,
 Interpreted by love.

[V4]
 With that deep hush subduing all
 Our words and works that drown
 The tender whisper of Thy call,
 As noiseless let Thy blessing fall
 As fell Thy manna down.

[V5]
 Drop Thy still dews of quietness,
 Till all our strivings cease;
 Take from our souls the strain and stress,
 And let our ordered lives confess
 The beauty of Thy peace.

[V6]
 Breathe through the heats of our desire
 Thy coolness and Thy balm;
 Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire
 Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
 O still small voice of calm!
