 Ride on! Ride on in majesty!
 Hark! all the tribes "Hosanna!" cry;
 O Saviour meek, pursue Thy road,
 With palms and scattered garments strowed.

[V2]
 Ride on! Ride on in majesty!
 In lowly pomp ride on to die:
 O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
 O'er captive death and conquered sin.

[V3]
 Ride on! Ride on in majesty!
 The angel armies of the sky
 Look down with sad and wondering eyes
 To see the approaching sacrifice.

[V4]
 Ride on! Ride on in majesty!
 Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh:
 The Father on His sapphire throne
 Awaits His own anointed Son.

[V5]
 Ride on! Ride on in majesty!
 In lowly pomp ride on to die:
 Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
 Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign.
