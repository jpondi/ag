1   I dare not be defeated,
    With Calvary in view,
    Where Jesus conquered Satan,
    Where all His foes he slew.
    Come, Lord, and give the vision
    To nerve me for the fight,
    Make me an overcomer
    Clothed with Thy Spirit's might.
    
2   I dare not be defeated Since
    Christ, my conquering King
    Has called me to the battle which
    He did surely win.
    Come, Lord, and give me courage,
    the conqu'ring Spirit give,
    Make me an overcomer,
    Thy pow'r within me live.
    
3.  I dare not be defeated,
    When Jesus leads me on
    To press through hellish regions
    To share with Him His Throne;
    Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier
    The pow'r to wield the sword,
    Make me an overcomer through
    Thine inerranrt Word.

4.  I dare not be defeated,
    Just at the set of sun,
    When Jesus waits to whisper,
    "Well done, beloved, well done"
    Come, Lord, bend from the Glory,
    On me Thy Spirit cast,
    Make me an overcomer,
    A victor to the last.
    A victor, a victor! Because of
    Calvary.

        Make me an overcomer,
        A conqu'ror, A conqu'ror,
        Lord, in Thee.
