 Sound the battle cry,
 See! the foe is nigh:
 Raise the standard high For the Lord!
 Gird your armour on,
 Stand firm every one,
 Rest your cause upon His Holy Word!

[C]
 Rouse, then, soldiers!
 Rally round the banner!
 Ready, steady, Pass the word along.
 Onward! forward! Shout aloud Hosanna!
 Christ is Captain Of the mighty throng!

[V2]
 Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go,
 While our cause we know Must prevail;
 Shield and banner bright Gleaming in the light,
 Battling for the right, We ne'er can fail!

[V3]
 O Thou God of all, Hear us when we call!
 Help us, one and all, By Thy grace:
 When the battle's done, And the victory won,
 May we wear the crown Before Thy face!
