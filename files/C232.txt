 Search me, O God,
 And know my heart today,;
 Try me, O Saviour,
 Know my thoughts, I pray ---
 See if there be ---
 Some wicked way in me ---
 Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.
 Lord, take my life ---
 And make it wholly Thine;
 Fill my poor heart with
 Thy great love divine:
 Take all my will,
 My passion and my pride; ---
 I now surrender: Lord, in me abide.
