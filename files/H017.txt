 God of all power, and truth, and grace,
 Which shall from age to age endure,
 Whose Word, when heaven and earth shall pass,
 Remains and stands for ever sure.

[V2]
 That I Thy mercy may proclaim,
 That all mankind Thy truth may see,
 Hallow Thy great and glorious Name,
 And perfect holiness in me.

[V3]
 Purge me from every evil blot;
 My idols all be cast aside;
 Cleanse me from every sinful thought,
 From all the filth of self and pride.

[V4]
 Give me a new, a perfect heart,
 From doubt, and fear, and sorrow free;
 The mind which was in Christ impart
 And let my spirit cleave to Thee.

[V5]
 O that I now, from sin released,
 Thy Word may to the utmost prove,
 Enter into the promised rest,
 The Canaan of Thy perfect love!
