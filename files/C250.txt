 The law of the Lord is perfect
 Converting the soul;
 The testimony of the Lord is sure,
 Making wise the simple.

[C]
 More to be desired are they than gold
 Yea, than much fine gold
 Sweeter also than the honey
 In the honeycomb.
 Moreover by them is Thy servant warned
 And in keeping of them there is great reward (2)

[V2]
 The statutes of the Lord are right,
 Rejoicing the heart,
 The commandments of the Lord are pure
 Enlightening the eyes.

[V3]
 The fear of the Lord is clean
 Enduring forever,
 The judgments of the Lord are true,
 And righteous altogether.
