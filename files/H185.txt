 When sitting or when standing,
 When sleeping or when walking,
 Thy hand is for ever on me.
 You're watching all my doings,
 And hearing all my sayings,
 As nothing can be hidden from Thee.

[C]
 On every side Thou compassest me, my God,
 I cannot comprehend this, I'm lost in wonder, Lord.

[V2]
 When problems overwhelm me,
 Thy wondrous help o'ertakes me,
 I see Thy tender care over me;
 From Thee there's no escaping,
 Thou readest ev'n my thinking
 Thy presence is ever near me.

[V3]
 My life from its beginning,
 Before Thine eyes unfolding
 So often I have grieved Thee, O Lord,
 Let me be always joyous,
 To work Thy holy purpose
 For Thou hast so loved me, my God.
