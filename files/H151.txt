 I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus
 Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true:
 I would tell you how He changed my life completely,
 He did something that no other friend could do.

[C]
 No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
 There's no other friend so kind as He:
 No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
 O how much He cared for me.

[V2]
 All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me,
 All my heart was full of misery and woe:
 Jesus placed His strong and loving arms about me,
 And He led me in the way I ought to go.

[V3]
 Ev'ryday He comes to me with new assurance,
 More and more I understand His words of love:
 But I'll never know just why He came to save me,
 Till some day I see His blessed face above.
