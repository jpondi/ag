 All people that on earth do dwell,
 Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
 Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell,
 Come ye before Him and rejoice.

[V2]
 Know that the Lord is God indeed:
 Without our aid He did us make:
 We are His flock, He doth us feed,
 And for His sheep He doth us take.

[V3]
 O enter then His gates with praise,
 Approach with joy His courts unto:
 Praise, laud and bless His Name always,
 For it is seemly so to do.

[V4]
 For why? The Lord our God is good,
 His mercy is forever sure;
 His truth at all times firmly stood,
 And shall from age to age endure.
