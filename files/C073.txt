 God forgave my sin in Jesus' Name,
 I've been born again in Jesus' Name;
 And in Jesus' Name I come to you,
 To share His love as He told me to.

[C]
 He said, "Freely, freely you have received;
 Freely freely give.
 Go in My Name and because you believe,
 Others will know that I live."

[V2]
 All pow'r is given in Jesus' Name,
 In earth and heaven in Jesus' Name;
 And in Jesus' Name I come to you,
 To share His pow'r as He told me to.
