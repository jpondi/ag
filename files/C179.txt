 Light of the world
 You stepped down into darkness
 Opened my eyes let me see
 Beauty that made
 This heart adore You
 Hope of a life spent with You

[C]
 Here I am to worship
 Here I am to bow down
 Here I am to say that You're my God.
 You're altogether lovely
 Altogether worthy
 Altogether wonderful to me.

[V2]
 King of all days
 Oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in heaven above
 Humbly You came
 To the earth You created
 All for love's sake became poor
 I'll never know how much it cost
 To see my sin upon that cross
 Call upon the Name of the Lord and be saved. (2)
