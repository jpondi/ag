1.  We sing the realms of the blest,
    Of that country so bright
    and so fair,
    And oft are its glories confessed,
    But what must it be to be there?

2.  We sing of the pathway of gold
    Of its walls decked with jewels
    so rare
    Of its wonders and pleasures
    untold
    But what must it be to be there?

3.  We sing of its freedom from sin
    From sorrow, temptation
    and care;
    From trials without and within,
    But what must it be to be there?

4.  We sing of the service of love,
    Of the robes which the glorified
    wear
    Of the church of the first-born
    above,
    But what must it be to be there?

5.  Dear Lord, amid sorrow and woe
    My spirit for heaven prepare,
    That shortly, I also may know
    And feel what it is to be there.

6.  There anthems of praise we will sing
    When safe in that haven of rest
    To Jesus, our Saviour and King
    Who reigns in those realms of
    the blest.
