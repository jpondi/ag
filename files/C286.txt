 When He sees His children
 The work of My hands,
 They shall sanctify My holy Name
 They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
 They shall fear the God of Israel.

[C]
 They that erred in spirit,
 Will come to understanding
 They that murmured will learn doctrine
 When He sees His children
 The work of My hands,
 They shall sanctify My holy Name

[V2]
 All your children shall be taught of the Lord
 And great shall be their peace
 When He sees His children
 The work of My hands,
 They shall sanctify My holy Name.
