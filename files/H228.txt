 Tenderly guide us, O Shepherd of love,
 To the green pastures and waters above;
 Guarding us ever by night and by day,
 Never from Thee would we stray.

[C]
 Never!...Never!...
 Never! oh, never, for Thou art the Way
 Never...Never!...
 Never from Thee would we stray!

[V2]
 What though the heavens with clouds be o'ercast
 Fearful the tempest, and bitter the blast?
 Still with the light of Thy Word on the way,
 Never from Thee would we stray.

[V3]
 Over our weakness Thy strength has been cast;
 Keep us in meekness, Thine own till the last:
 Then safely folded, with joy we shall say
 Never from Thee would we stray.
