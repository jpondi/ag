 As the deer pants for the water,
 So my soul longs after You.
 You alone are my heart's desire
 And I long to worship You.

[C]
 You alone are my strength, my shield
 To You alone may my spirit yield.
 You alone are my heart's desire
 And I long to worship you.

[V2]
 I want You more than gold or silver
 Only You can satisfy.
 You alone are the real joy-giver,
 And the apple of my eye.

[V3]
 You're my Friend and
 You are my Brother
 Even though You are a King.
 I love You more than any other
 So much more than anything.
