 Lord of all creation
 Of water, earth and sky
 The heavens are Your tabernacle
 Glory to the Lord on high
 God of wonders beyond our galaxy
 You are holy, holy
 The universe declares Your majesty
 You are holy, holy
 Lord of heaven and earth (2)
 Early in the morning
 I will celebrate the light
 When I stumble in the darkness
 I will call Your name by night
 Hallelujah, to the Lord of Heaven and earth (3)
 Precious Lord, reveal Your heart to me
 Father, hold me, hold me
 The universe declares our majesty
 You are holy, holy.
