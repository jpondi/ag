 The love of God is greater far
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
 It goes beyond the highest star,
 And reaches to the lowest hell.
 The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
 God gave His Son to win;
 His erring child He reconciled,
 And pardoned from his sin.

[C]
 Oh, love of God, how rich and pure
 How measureless and strong!
 It shall for evermore endure-
 The saints' and angels' song.

[V2]
 When hoary time shall pass away,
 And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
 When men who here refuse to pray
 On rocks and hills and mountains call;
 God's love, so pure, shall still endure,
 All measureless and strong;
 Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
 The saints' and angels' song.

[V3]
 Could we with ink the ocean fill,
 And were the skies of parchment made;
 Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill,
 And ev'ry man a scribe by trade;
 To write the love of God above
 Would drain the ocean dry;
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
 Tho' stretched from sky to sky.
