 How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
 In a believer's ear!
 It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
 And drives away his fear.

[V2]
 It makes the wounded spirit whole,
 And calms the troubled breast;
 `Tis manna to the hungry soul,
 And to the weary rest.

[V3]
 Dear Name, the rock on which I build,
 My shield and hiding-place,
 My never-failing treasury, filled
 With boundless stores of grace!

[V4]
 Jesus! my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend;
 My Prophet, Priest, and King;
 My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End;
 Accept the praise I bring.

[V5]
 Weak is the effort of my heart,
 And cold my warmest thought;
 But when I see Thee as Thou art,
 I'll praise Thee as I ought.

[V6]
 Till then, I would Thy love proclaim
 With every fleeting breath;
 And may the music of Thy name
 Refresh my soul in death.
