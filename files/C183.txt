 Lord, I lift Your Name on high
 Lord, I love to sing Your praises
 I'm so glad You're in my life
 I'm so glad You came to save us.

[C]
 You came from Heaven to Earth
 To show the way,
 From the Earth to the Cross
 My debts to pay,
 From the Cross to the Grave,
 From the Grave to the Sky,
 Lord, I lift Your name on high.
