 Come, all India, to God, to the most loving Father.
 Come, all India, to God, to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[V1]
 To the God of Abram and Isaac and Jacob.
 To the one and only, true and living God.

[V2]
 Come to God confessing, repenting acknowledging,
 Jesus Christ as Saviour, as your Lord and King.
