1.  How good is the God we adore,
    Our faithful
    unchangeable Friend!
    His love is as
    great as His power,
    And knows neither
    measure nor end!

2.  Tis Jesus the
    First and the Last,
    Whose Spirit shall
    Guide us safe home,
    We'll praise Him for
    all that is past,
    And trust Him for
    all that's to come.
