 Beautiful people with beautiful feet,
 Lined up and ready to go
 Into the world with the Gospel of Peace---
 Lined up and ready to go!

[V1]
 Lifting up banners of lands far and near,
 covered with "banner of love."
 Marching "in-step" with the heart beat of God,
 Hovered by God's Holy Dove.

[V2]
 Into a war-ridden, dark, angry world,
 Armed with glad tidings of peace.
 Love motivated, they pray while they sow;
 Praise as God gives the increase!

[V3]
 Loving their Lord more than life or themselves;
 Loving the people they tell
 Colourful,passionate, sanctified honed;
 Ready to rescue from hell.

[V4]
 Called and commissioned to go in His name---
 Name above all, Jesus Christ,
 Serving their Captain, the Lord Jesus Christ---
 Hearts racing fast for the world.

[V5]
 Ready to go through whatever it takes,
 Takes to deliver God's word.
 Ready to go to the ends of the earth,
 Serving their beautiful Lord!
