Lord, I come, I confess (AR24.15)
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You're the One that guides my heart
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Where sin runs deep
Your grace is more
Where grace is found is
where You are


Where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me
So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus, You're my hope and stay
