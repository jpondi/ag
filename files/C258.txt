 There is power in the name of Jesus;
 We believe in His name.
 We have called on the name of Jesus;
 We are saved! We are saved!
 At His name the demons flee.
 At His name captives are freed;
 For there is no other name that is higher, Than Jesus!

[V2]
 There is power in the name of Jesus,
 Like a sword in our hands.
 We declare in the name of Jesus,
 We shall stand! We shall stand!
 At His name God's enemies;
 Shall be crushed beneath our feet,
 For there is no other name that is higher, than Jesus.
