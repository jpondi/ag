 A Christian band... from far and near,...
 We meet to learn... of Jesus here;...
 To read His Word,... whose ev'ry line...
 Is filled with hope... and joy divine....

[C]
 May our Endeavour Band,
 Now gathered in His name,
 United heart and hand,
 Go forth to spread His fame!
 Then firmly let us stand,
 For God and native land,
 And pray that He may bless
 And keep our Christian band.

[V2]
 We gather here,... where all may sing...
 Glad songs of praise... to Christ our King;...
 Where youthful hearts... may find the way...
 That leads to life... and endless day...

[V3]
 The Master's work... we'll still pursue,...
 And here again... our pledge renew,...
 To follow Him;... to trust His love,...
 Till gathered home... with Him above...
