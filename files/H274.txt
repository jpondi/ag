 Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
 It is not night if Thou be near;
 O may no earth-born cloud arise
 To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes!

[V2]
 When the soft dews of kindly sleep
 My wearied eyelids gently steep,
 Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
 For ever on my Saviour's breast!

[V3]
 Abide with me from morn till eve,
 For without Thee I cannot live;
 Abide with me when night is nigh,
 For without Thee I dare not die.

[V4]
 If some poor wandering child of Thine
 Have spurned today the voice divine,
 Now, Lord, the gracious work begin:
 Let him no more lie down in sin.

[V5]
 Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
 With blessings from Thy boundless store:
 Be every mourner's sleep tonight
 Like infant's slumbers, pure and light.

[V6]
 Come near and bless us when we wake,
 Ere through the world our way we take;
 Till, in the ocean of Thy love
 We lose overselves in heav'n above.
