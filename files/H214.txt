 Who is on the Lord's side?
 Who will serve the King?
 Who will be His helper,
 Other lives to bring?
 Who will leave the world's side?
 Who will face the foe?
 Who is on the Lord's side?
 Who for Him will go?

[C]
 By Thy grand redemption
 By Thy grace divine,
 We are on the Lord's side
 Saviour, we are Thine!

[V2]
 Not for weight of glory,
 Not for crown and palm,
 Enter we the army,
 Raise the warrior psalm;
 But for Love that claimeth
 Lives for whom He died:
 He whom Jesus nameth
 Must be on His side.

[C2]
 By Thy love constraining,
 By Thy grace divine,
 We are on the Lord's side:
 Saviour, we are Thine!

[V3]
 Jesus, Thou hast bought us,
 Not with gold or gem,
 But with Thine own life-blood,
 For Thy diadem;
 With Thy blessing filling
 All who come to Thee,
 Thou hast made us willing,
 Thou hast made us free.

[C3]
 By Thy grand redemption,
 By Thy grace divine,
 We are on the Lord's side:
 Saviour, we are Thine!

[V4]
 Fierce may be the conflict,
 Strong may be the foe,
 But the King's own army
 None can overthrow;
 Round His standard ranging,
 Vict'ry is secure,
 For His truth unchanging
 Makes the triumph sure.

[C4]
 Joyfully enlisting,
 By Thy grace divine,
 We are on the Lord's side
 Saviour we are Thine!

[V5]
 Chosen to be soldiers
 In an alien land,
 "Chosen called, and faithful,"
 For our Captain's band
 In His service royal,
 Let us not grow cold;
 Let us be right loyal,
 Noble, true, and bold.

[C5]
 Master, Thou wilt keep us
 By Thy grace divine,
 Always on the Lord's side,
 Saviour, always Thine!
