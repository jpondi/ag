 For this purpose Christ was revealed,
 To destroy all the works of the evil one;
 Christ in us has overcome,
 So with gladness we sing
 And welcome His Kingdom in.

[C]
 Over sin He has conquered,
 Hallelujah, He has conquered;
 Over death victorious,
 Hallelujah, victorious;
 Over sickness He has triumphed,
 Hallelujah, He has triumphed;
 Jesus reigns over all!

[V2]
 In the name of Jesus we stand
 By the power of His blood,
 we now claim this ground;
 Satan has no authority here,
 Powers of darkness must flee
 For Christ has the victory.
