My Saviour, Redeemer,
lifted me from the miry clay
Almighty, forever,
I will never be the same

'Cause you came near,
from the everlasting
To the world we live,
the Father's only Son

You lived and You died,
You rose again on high
You opened the way,
for the world to live again
Hallelujah, for all You've done.
