 God of all Ages Thou art the same
 Jesus the Saviour, is Thy Name
 Through all of time, in every clime
 Thy Name brings hope and joy sublime.

[V2]
 Sing hosts of heaven, 'Jesus reigns',
 Ring in the new Millennial strains
 Timeless as ever the Saviour lives
 Lift high His Cross, What pow'r He gives!

[V3]
 Oh what a Saviour is Jesus my Lord!
 True and faithful, unchangeable friend,
 He sets sin-ridden hearts a flame
 Matchless in love, He's ev'r the same.

[V4]
 Fill with Thyself Lord Jesus Christ
 To wrestle in pray'r for eternal souls,
 Pleasing you ever doing Your will
 Through paths unknown, You'll lead us still.

[V5]
 God of all Ages walk ahead
 In Thy footsteps we'll safely tread,
 Shouting Thy triumph through all Earth's storms,
 `Neath us are Thine everlasting arms.
