 O Lord, you've done great things, and I will praise you;
 I will extol you and magnify Your Name.
 O Lord, You've done great things, and I will praise you;
 I will extol You and magnify Your Name.
 I will sing praises unto You, and remember Your goodness;
 My past is forgiven and now I have life.
 You crown me with steadfast love and tender mercy,
 I'll do Your will and bless-You, O Lord.
