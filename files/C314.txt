Lord pour out Your Spirit
On all the peoples of the earth
Let Your sons and daughters
Speak Your words of prophesy
Send us dreams and visions
Reveal the secrets of Your heart
Lord our faith is rising
Let all Heaven sound the coming
of Your day.

There's gonna be a great 
awakening
There's gonna be a great revival
in our land
There's gonna be a great
awakening
And everyone who calls on
Jesus
They will be saved.

Lord pour out Your Spirit
On all the nations of the world
Let them see Your glory
Let them fall in reverent awe
Show Your mighty power
Shake the heavens and the earth
Lord the world is waiting
Let creation see the coming of
Your day.
