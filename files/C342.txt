Jesus hope of the nations
Jesus comfort for all who mourn
You are the source of Heaven's
hope on earth

Jesus light in the darkness
Jesus truth in each circumstance
You are the source of Heaven's
light on earth

In history You lived and died
You broke the chains You rose to life

You are the hope living in us
You are the rock in Whom we trust
You are the light
Shining for all the world to see

You rose from the dead
conquering fear
Our Prince of Peace 
drawing us near
Jesus our hope 
living for all who will receive
Lord we believe
