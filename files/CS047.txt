Let the weak say, "I am strong" (AR25.2) 
Let the poor say, "I am rich" 
Let the blind say, "I can see"
It's what the Lord has done in me

Hosanna, hosanna
To the Lamb that was slain 
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again mo

Into the river, I will wade
There my sins are washed away 
From the heavens mercy streams 
Of the Saviour's love for me

I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God
I will sing salvation songs
Jesus Christ has set me free

Annual Retreat 2005 song#2
