 I'm satisfied with just a cottage below,
 A little silver and a little gold:
 But in that city where the
 ransomed will shine,
 I want a gold one that's silver-lined.
 I've got a mansion just over the hill top,
 In that bright land where
 we'll never grow old;
 And some day yonder
 we'll never more wander
 But walk the streets that
 are purest gold.
