 Come on and celebrate!
 His gift of love we will celebrate
 The Son of God,who loved us
 And gave us life.
 We'll shout your praise,O King:
 You give us joy nothing else can bring;
 We'll give to You our offering
 in celebration praise.
 Come on and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate and sing,
 Celebrate and sing to the King.
 (Repeat)
