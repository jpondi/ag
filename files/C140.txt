 In His time, In His time,
 He makes all things beautiful in His time,
 Lord, please show me every day,
 As you're teaching me your way,
 That you do just what you say, in your time.

[V2]
 In your time, in your time,
 You make all things beautiful, in your time.
 Lord, my life to you I bring,
 May each song I have to sing
 Be to you a lovely thing, in your time.
