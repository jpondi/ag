 Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
 Draw me, my Saviour, so precious Thou art;
 Fold me, Oh, fold me close to Thy breast,
 Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest,"
 Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest."

[V2]
 Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
 Naught as an offering to Jesus my King;
 Only my sinful, now contrite heart,
 Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
 Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

[V3]
 Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,
 `Til safe in glory my anchor is cast;
 Through endless ages, ever to be,
 Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,
 Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
