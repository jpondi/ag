 Kingdoms may rise, kingdoms may fall,
 Nations refuse to hear God's call,
 But the Word of the Lord endureth for evermore.
 Things that we love last for a day
 Then in the morning fade away
 But the Word of the Lord endureth for evermore.
 Take God at His promise, put your faith in Christ.
 Trust Him for salvation and eternal life.
 Things that we love . . .
