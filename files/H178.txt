 "My grace is sufficient"- the Saviour hath spoken-
 I rest on the truth of His Word;
 I know that His promise hath never been broken,
 The faithful, unchangeable Lord.

[V2]
 "My grace is sufficient"-no word of a stranger
 Could give me this confidence deep;
 But He is my succour in doubt or in danger,
 Almighty to save and to keep.

[V3]
 "My grace is sufficient"- unmerited favour
 To me, full of failure and sin;
 Though I am but weakness, my glorious Saviour
 Will finish what He did begin.

[V4]
 "My grace is sufficient"-I tremble no longer;
 My best resolutions may fail;
 Yet I trust Him with faith ever stronger and stronger:
 His promise must ever prevail.

[V5]
 "My grace is sufficient"- exhaustless in measure,
 Though millions appeal in their need;
 My Saviour, I praise Thee, I take of the treasure,
 Thy grace is sufficient indeed.
