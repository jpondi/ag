 Thy loving kindness is better than life,
 Thy loving kindness is better than life,
 My lips shall praise Thee
 Thus will I bless Thee,
 Thy loving kindness is better than life.

[C]
 I lift my hands up unto Thy name
 I lift my hands up unto Thy name
 My lips shall praise Thee
 Thus will I bless Thee
 I lift my hands up unto Thy name
