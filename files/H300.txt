1.  Let not thy hands be slack,
    Live not in vain;
    Out on life's lonely track
    Men toil in pain.
    Play thou a brother's part,
    Strength, love and hope impart,
    Bid thou the fainting heart
    Look up again!
    
2.  Let not thy hands be slack,
    Grip thou thy sword!
    Why should'st thou courage lack?
    Think of thy Lord.
    Did He not fight for thee?
    Stronger than all is He,
    And He thy strength will be,
    Rest on His word.

3.  Let not thy hands be slack,
    Haste to the fray!
    Dream not of turning back:
    Life is not play!
    Gird thou thy armour on,
    Fight till the battle's won,
    Then shall thy Lord's "Well done!"
    More than repay!

4.  Let not thy hand be slack,
    Fear not! Be strong!
    Cease not to make attack
    On every wrong.
    Press on for truth and right,
    Hold high the Gospel light,
    Expel the dirge of night
    With heaven's song!
