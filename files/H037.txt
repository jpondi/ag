 More about Jesus would I know,
 More of His grace to others show;
 More of His saving, fulness see,
 More of His love who died for me.

[C]
 More, more about Jesus,
 More, more about Jesus;
 More of His saving fulness see,
 More of His love who died for me.

[V2]
 More about Jesus let me learn
 More of His holy will discern;
 Spirit of God, my Teacher be,
 Showing the things of Christ to me.

[V3]
 More about Jesus in His Word,
 Holding communion with my Lord;
 Hearing His voice in every line,
 Making each faithful saying mine.

[V4]
 More about Jesus on His throne,
 Riches in glory all His own;
 More of His kingdom's sure increase
 More of His coming, Prince of Peace
