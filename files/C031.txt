 Blessing and Honour, Glory and Power,
 Be unto the `Ancient of Days'
 From every nation all of creation
 Bow before the `Ancient of Days'
 Every tongue in Heaven and Earth
 Shall declare Your glory
 Every knee will bow at Your throne
 In worship
 You'll be exalted, O God
 And Your Kingdom will not pass away
 O `Ancient of Days'
