 There's just something about my Jesus,
 Something that I can't explain,
 For since I met this blessed Saviour
 My life has been so re-arranged:
 Well, if you're looking for friendship,
 Contentment and peace
 Just try Him and you will see-
 There's something about my Jesus,
 Something about my Lord.
