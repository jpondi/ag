 Forty days and forty nights,
 Thou wast fasting in the wild,
 Forty days and forty nights,
 Tempted, and yet undefiled.

[V2]
 Sunbeams scorching all the day
 Chilly dew drops nightly shed,
 Prowling beasts about Thy way,
 Stones Thy pillow, earth Thy bed.

[V3]
 Let us Thy endurance share
 And from earthly greed abstain
 With Thee watching unto prayer,
 With Thee strong to suffer pain.

[V4]
 And if Satan, vexing sore,
 Flesh or spirit should assail,
 Thou, his Vanquisher before,
 Grant we may not faint nor fail.

[V5]
 So shall we have peace divine;
 Holier gladness ours shall be;
 Round us too shall angels shine,
 Such as ministered to Thee.
