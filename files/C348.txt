The splendour of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice (2)
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice (2)

How great is our God
Sing along
How great is our God
And all will see
How great how great is our God

Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end (2)
The Godhead three in one
He's the Father Spirits Son
The Lion and the Lamb (2)

You're the name above all names
You are worthy of our praise
And my heart will sing
How great is our God
