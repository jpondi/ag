 Thine for ever: God of love,
 Hear us from Thy throne above;
 Thine for ever may we be,
 Here and in eternity.

[V2]
 Thine for ever: Lord of life,
 Shield us through our earthly strife;
 Thou the Life, the Truth, the Way
 Guide us to the realms of day.

[V3]
 Thine for ever: oh, how blest
 They who find in Thee their rest;
 Saviour, Guardian, heavenly Friend,
 Oh, defend us to the end!

[V4]
 Thine for ever: Shepherd, keep
 These Thy frail and trembling sheep;
 Safe alone beneath Thy care,
 Let us all Thy goodness share.

[V5]
 Thine for ever: Thou our Guide,
 All our wants by Thee supplied,
 All our sins by Thee forgiven,
 Lead us, Lord, from earth to heaven.
