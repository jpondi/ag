 There are two ways built for you and me,
 That's the Bible story,
 The broad way is with danger filled,
 The straight one leads to Glory.

[C]
 (So then) Which way are you travelling? (3)
 The broad or narrow way.

[V2]
 Oh, 'tis sweet to know that day by day
 Jesus walks beside me;
 With my hand in His I cannot stray
 And safely He will guide me.
