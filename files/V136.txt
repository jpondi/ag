When I get to heaven 
gonna walk with Jesus 
When I get to heaven 
I see his face 
When I get to heaven gonna talk with Jesus
I’m saved by his wonderful grace

Cho: Because I’m saved, saved,
Wonderfully saved, washed in the 
Blood of the lamb
Saved, I’m saved
wonderfully saved and I’m so glad I am
Halleluiah
