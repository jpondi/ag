 Out in the highways and byways of life,
 Many are weary and sad;
 Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife,
 Making the sorrowing glad.

[C]
 Make me a blessing, make me a blessing
 Out of my life may Jesus shine;
 Make me a blessing, O Saviour, I pray,
 Make me a blessing to someone today.

[V2]
 Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love,
 Tell of His pow'r to forgive;
 Others will trust Him if only you
 prove
 True, every moment you live.

[V3]
 Give as `twas given to you in your need,
 Love as the Master loved you;
 Be to the helpless a helper indeed,
 Unto your mission be true.
