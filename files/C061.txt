 Flawless in His perfection
 Peerless in His purity,
 Boundless in His grace to sinners
 That's my Jesus!

[C]
 That's my Jesus,
 My matchless Saviour!
 Crown Him now
 Lord of your life
 And joy unspeakable will flood your soul
 And joy unspeakable will flood your soul.

[V2]
 Incomparable in compassion
 Measureless in His Might and power
 Everlasting, His unchanging love
 That's my Jesus!
