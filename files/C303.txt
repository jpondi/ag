 Your only Son, no sin to hide,
 But You have sent Him from Your side
 To walk upon this guilty sod
 And to become the Lamb of God.

[V2]
 Your Gift of Love they crucified
 They laughed and scorned Him as He died;
 The humble King they named a fraud
 And sacrificed the Lamb of God.

[C]
 O Lamb of God, Blest Lamb of God,
 I love the Holy Lamb of God,
 O wash me in Your precious blood,
 My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God.

[V3]
 I was so lost I should have died,
 But You have brought me to Your side.
 To be led by Your staff and rod,
 And to be called a lamb of God.
