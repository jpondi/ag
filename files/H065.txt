 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
 Call for songs of loudest praise
 Teach me some melodious measure
 Sing by flaming tongues above
 O the vast, the boundless treasure
 Of my Lord's unchanging love.

[V2]
 Here I raise my Ebenezer
 Hither by Thy help I'm come
 And I hope by Thy good pleasure,
 Safely to arrive at home
 Jesus sought me when a stranger,
 Wandering from the fold of God;
 He, to rescue me from danger,
 Interposed His precious blood.

[V3]
 Oh, to grace how great a debtor
 Daily I'm constrained to be!
 Let that grace, Lord like a fetter,
 Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it,
 Prone to leave the God I love;
 Here's my heart; Lord, take and seal it,
 Seal it from Thy courts above.
