 "Whosoever heareth!" Shout, shout the sound!
 Send the blessed tidings all the world around!
 Spread the joyful news wherever man is found,
 "Whosoever will may come."

[C]
 "Whosoever will! whosoever will!"
 Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
 `Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
 "Whosoever will may come!"

[V2]
 "Whosoever cometh!" need not delay,
 Now the door is open, enter while you may,
 Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
 "Whosoever will may come."

[V3]
 "Whosoever will," the promise is secure;
 "Whosoever will," forever must endure;
 "Whosoever will," tis life for evermore;
 "Whosoever will may come."
