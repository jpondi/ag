 God will make a way
 Where there seems to be no way
 He works in ways we cannot see
 He will make a way for me
 He will be my guide
 Hold me closely to His side
 With love and strength
 For each new day
 He will make a way (2)
 By a roadway in the wilderness He will lead me.
 Rivers in the desert will I see
 Heaven and earth will fade
 But His Word will still remain
 He will do something new today
