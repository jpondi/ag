 Far, far away in heathen darkness dwelling,
 Millions of souls for ever may be lost;
 Who, who will go---Salvation's story telling---
 Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?

[C]
 "All power is given unto Me!
 All power is given unto Me!
 Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel;
 And lo! I am with you alway."

[V2]
 See o'er the world, wide open doors inviting;
 Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!
 Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,
 Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin!

[V3]
 "Why will ye die?" the voice of God is calling;
 "Why will ye die?" re-echo in His Name;
 Jesus hath died to save from death appalling;
 Life and salvation therefore go proclaim.

[V4]
 God speed the day when those of every nation,
 "Glory to God" triumphantly shall sing;
 Ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation,
 Shout, "Hallelujah, for the Lord is King!"
