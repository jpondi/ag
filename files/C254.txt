 There has never been a friend like Jesus,
 I have never found a friend so true;
 When I weaken and my steps grow wayward,
 Then He comes to me with strength anew.

[C]
 We walk hand in hand through this pilgrim land
 Here we linger for a day;
 But soon we'll leave this land of night
 For that land so bright- There my friend and I will stay.

[V2]
 Let me recommend this friend so faithful
 He will understand your deepest need;
 For He walked this lonely path before us,
 And He's able ev'ry step to lead.
