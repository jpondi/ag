 Oh! what a wonderful, wonderful day,
 Day I will never forget,
 After I wandered in darkness away,
 Jesus my Saviour I met.
 Oh! what a tender, compassionate friend,
 He met the need of my heart,
 Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
 He made all the darkness depart.

[C]
 Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
 When at the cross my Saviour made me whole,
 My sins were washed away, and my night was turned to day
 Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

[V2]
 Now I've a hope that will surely endure,
 After the passing of time,
 I have a future in Heaven for sure,
 There in those mansions sublime.
 And it's because of that wonderful day,
 There on the cross I believed,
 Riches eternal and blessings supernal,
 From His precious hands I received.
