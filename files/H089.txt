 "Man of sorrows!" what a name
 For the Son of God, who came
 Ruined sinners to reclaim!
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[V2]
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
 In my place condemned he stood;
 Sealed my pardon with His blood:
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[V3]
 Guide, vile, and helpless, we;
 Spotless Lamb of God was He:
 "Full atonement" - can it be?
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[V4]
 "Lifted up" was He to die,
 "It is finished!" was His cry:
 Now in heaven exalted high:
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

[V5]
 When He comes, our glorious King
 All His ransomed home to bring
 Then anew this song we'll sing:
 "Hallelujah! what a Saviour!"
