 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart
 Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art;
 Thou my best thought, by day or by night
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

[V2]
 Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
 Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.

[V3]
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
 Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
 High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

[V4]
 High King of heaven, my victory won,
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun!
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
