 I was sinking deep in sin,
 Far from the peaceful shore,
 Very deeply stained within,
 Sinking to rise no more;
[V2] 
 But the Master of the sea
 Heard my despairing cry,
 From the waters lifted me
 Now safe am I.
[V3]
 Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
 When nothing else could help,
 Love lifted me! (Repeat)
