 Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
 O'er the worlds tempestuous sea;
 Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
 For we have no help but Thee;
 Yet possessing every blessing,
 If our God our Father be.

[V2]
 Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us;
 All our weakness Thou dost know;
 Thou didst tread this earth before us,
 Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
 Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
 Through the desert Thou didst go.

[V3]
 Spirit of our God, descending,
 Fill our hearts with heavenly joy;
 Love with every passion blending,
 Pleasure that can never cloy:
 Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
 Nothing can our peace destroy.
