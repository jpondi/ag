 Lord, in the fulness of my might
 I would for Thee be strong;
 While runneth o'er each dear delight
 To Thee should soar my song.

[V2]
 I would not give the world my heart,
 And then profess Thy love;
 I would not feel my strength depart
 And then Thy service prove.

[V3]
 I would not with swift-winged zeal
 On the world's errands go,
 And labour up the heavenly hill
 With weary feet and slow.

[V4]
 Oh, not for Thee my weak desires,
 My poorer, baser part!
 Oh, not for Thee my fading fires,
 The ashes of my heart.

[V5]
 Oh, choose me in my golden time,
 In my dear joys have part;
 For Thee the glory of my prime,
 The fulness of my heart!

[V6]
 I cannot, Lord, too early take
 The covenant divine:
 Oh, ne'er the happy heart may break
 Whose earliest love was Thine.
