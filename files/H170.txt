 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 Let me hide myself in Thee;
 Let the water and the blood,
 From Thy riven side which flowed,
 Be of sin the double cure
 Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

[V2]
 Not the labour of my hands
 Can fulfil Thy law's demands:
 Could my zeal no respite know,
 Could my tears for ever flow,
 All for sin could not atone;
 Thou must save, and Thou alone.

[V3]
 Nothing in my hand I bring;
 Simply to Thy cross I cling:
 Naked, come to Thee for dress;
 Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
 Foul, I to the fountain fly:
 Wash me, Saviour, or I die!

[V4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath,
 When mine eyelids close in death,
 When I soar to worlds unknown,
 See Thee on Thy judgment throne:
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 Let me hide myself in Thee.
