 When all my labours and trials are o'er,
 And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
 Just to be near the dear Lord I adore
 Will thro' the ages be glory for me.

[C]
 O, that will be glory for me, glory for me, glory for me,
 When by His grace I shall look on His face,
 That will be glory, be glory for me!

[V2]
 When, by the gift of His infinite grace,
 I am accorded in Heaven a place,
 Just to be there and to look on His face,
 Will thro' the ages be glory for me.

[V3]
 Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
 Joy like a river around me will flow;
 Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
 Will thro' the ages be glory for me.
