I met Jesus at the crossroads, 
Where the two way meet 
Satan too was standing there,
And he said, “Come the way 
Lots and lots of pleasures
I can give you today.”
But I said, “No, there’s Jesus here.
Just see what He offers me,
Down there my sins forgiven,
Up there a home in heaven 
Praise God! That’s the way for me”
