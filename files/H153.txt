 Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
 The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

[V2]
 Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
 To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.

[V3]
 Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?
 On Jesus' bosom naught but calm is found.

[V4]
 Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
 In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.

[V5]
 Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
 Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.

[V6]
 Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?
 Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers

[V7]
 It is enough:earth's struggles soon shall cease,
 And Jesus call us to heaven's perfect peace.
