 More holiness give me,
 More strivings, within;
 More patience in suffering,
 More sorrow for sin;
 More faith in my Saviour,
 More sense of His care;
 More joy in His service,
 More purpose in prayer.

[V2]
 More gratitude give me,
 More trust in the Lord;
 More zeal for His glory,
 More hope in His Word;
 More tears for His sorrows,
 More pain at His grief;
 More meekness in trial,
 More praise for relief.

[V3]
 More purity give me,
 More strength to o'ercome;
 More freedom from earth-stains,
 More longings for home;
 More fit for the kingdom,
 More used would I be,
 More blessed and holy,
 More, Saviour, like Thee!
