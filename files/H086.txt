 At even ere the sun was set,
 The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;
 Oh, in what divers pains they met!
 Oh, with what joy they went away!

[V2]
 Once more `tis eventide, and we
 Oppressed with various ills draw near,
 What if Thy form we cannot see?
 We know and feel that Thou art here.

[V3]
 O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel:
 For some are sick; and some are sad;
 And some have never loved Thee well;
 And some have lost the love they had;

[V4]
 And some have found the world is vain,
 Yet from the world they break not free;
 And some have friends who give them pain,
 Yet have not sought a Friend in Thee.

[V5]
 And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
 For none are wholly free from sin;
 And they who fain would serve Thee best
 Are conscious most of wrong within.

[V6]
 O Saviour Christ Thou too art Man;
 Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;
 Thy kind but searching glance can scan
 The very wounds that shame would hide.

[V7]
 Thy touch has still its ancient power;
 No word from Thee can fruitless fall;
 Hear, in this solemn evening hour,
 And in Thy mercy heal us all.
