 I want to walk with Jesus Christ,
 All the days I live of this life on earth,
 To give to Him complete control
 Of body and of soul.

[C]
 Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him
 He has conquered death, He is King of kings;
 Accept the joy which He gives to those
 Who yield their lives to Him.

[V2]
 I want to learn to speak to Him,
 To pray to Him, confess my sin,
 To open my life and let Him in
 For joy will then be mine.

[V3]
 I want to learn to speak of HIm,--
 My life must show that He lives in me,
 My deeds, my thoughts, my words must speak
 All of His love for me.

[V4]
 I want to learn to read His Word,
 For this is how I know the way,
 To live my life as pleases Him,
 In holiness and joy.

[V5]
 O Holy Spirit of the Lord,
 Enter now into this heart of mine,
 Take full control of my selfish will
 And make me wholly Thine!
