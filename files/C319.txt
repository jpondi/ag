The nails in your hand, 
the nail in your feet
They tell me how much
you love me

The thorns on your brow,
they tell me how
You bore so much shame to
love me

And when the heavens
pass away
All your scars will still remain
And forever they will say
Just how much you love me
So I want to say ..

Forever my love, forever my heart
Forever my life is Yours
