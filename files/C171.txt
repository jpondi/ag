 Let me be a living fire
 For your glory, King of kings;
 Fill my soul with pure desire,
 Ever while I live.
 Help me choose unselfishly,
 From this world I would be free,
 For all its sin and vanity ---
 Broke Your tender heart.
 Let our hearts with motives clean
 Give You joy and make us sing
 In Your presence praise we bring
 Ever while we live, ever while we live.
