 In heavenly armour we'll enter the land
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
 No weapons that's fashioned
 against us shall stand,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.

[C]
 We sing glory and honour
 Power and strength to the Lord.(2)

[V2]
 The power of darkness comes in like a flood,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
 He's raised up a standard the power of His blood,
 The battle belongs to the Lord.

[V3]
 When your enemy presses in hard, do not fear;
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
 Take courage, my friend your redemption is near;
 The battle belongs to the Lord.
