Victory is mine, victory is mine
Victory today is mine
I told Satan to get thee behind
Victory today is mine

When I rose this morning
i didn't have no doubt
I knew that the Lord would bring
me out
I fell on my knees
Said, "Lord, help me please"
Got up singing and shouting the
victory

Joy is mine ...

Happiness is mine ...
