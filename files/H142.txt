 The Great Physician now is near,
 The sympathizing Jesus:
 He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
 Oh, hear the voice of Jesus!

[C]
 Sweetest note in seraph song,
 Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
 Sweetest carol ever sung: Jesus, blessed Jesus!

[V2]
 Your many sins are all forgiven,
 Oh, hear the voice of Jesus!
 Go on your way in peace to heaven
 And wear a crown with Jesus.

[V3]
 All glory to the dying Lamb!
 I now believe in Jesus!
 I love the blessed Saviour's name,
 I love the name of Jesus.
