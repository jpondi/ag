 Jesus, the very thought of Thee
 With sweetness fills my breast;
 But sweeter far Thy face to see,
 And in Thy presence rest.

[V2]
 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
 Nor can the memory find
 A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,
 O Saviour of mankind!

[V3]
 Oh, hope of every contrite heart,
 Oh, joy of all the meek;
 To those who fall, how kind Thou art,
 How good to those who seek!

[V4]
 But what to those who find? Ah! this
 Nor tongue nor pen can show;
 The love of Jesus, what it is
 None but His loved ones know.

[V5]
 Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
 As Thou our prize wilt be;
 Jesus, be Thou our glory now,
 And through eternity.
