1. Who have I ... who have I ... who
have I, in heaven, but Thee?
There is none ... not a one ... I
desire, on earth, beside Thee.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ... there's no
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ... not a one
like Jesus

2. Oh, how I'd miss Him, if He
weren't here.
Oh, what a wonder, having Him
near.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ... joyful
friend is Jesus

3. Faithful, consistent, steady and
sure ...
Lovingly truthful, peaceful and
pure ...
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus .... so
unique is Jesus.

4. Life without Jesus would be so
grim ...
Lonely and hopeless, dark
without Him.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus .... shining
light is Jesus.

5. Strengthening, healing, ... helping
me through.
How I would miss Him ... if He
withdrew.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ... who have I,
but Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ... there's
no one like Jesus
Who have I, who have I, who
have I in heaven, but Thee.
There is none, not a one, I desire
on earth, beside Thee.

Psalms 74:24 & 26. Isaiah 45:6
