 Things are different now,
 Something happened to me,
 When I gave my heart to Jesus.
 Things are different now,
 I was changed, it must be,
 When I gave my heart to Him.
 Things I loved before have passed away,
 Things I love far more have come to stay.
 Things are different now,
 Something happened to me,
 When I gave my heart to Jesus.
