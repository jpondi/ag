 Come, ye that love the Lord,
 And let your joys be known,
 Join in a song with sweet accord,
 And thus surround the throne.

[C]
 We're marching to Zion,
 Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
 We're marching upward to Zion,
 The beautiful city of God.

[V2]
 Let those refuse to sing
 Who never knew our God;
 But children of the heavenly King
 Must speak their joys abroad.

[V3]
 The hill of Zion yields
 A thousand sacred sweets,
 Before we reach the heavenly fields,
 Or walk the golden streets.

[V4]
 Then let our songs abound,
 And every tear be dry;
 We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
 To fairer worlds on high.
