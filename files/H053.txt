 Rejoice, the Lord is King!
 Your Lord and King adore;
 Mortals, give thanks and sing,
 And triumph evermore:

[C]
 Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
 Rejoice! again I say: rejoice!

[V2]
 Jesus, the Saviour, reigns,
 The God of truth and love:
 When He had purged our stains,
 He took His seat above:

[V3]
 His kingdom cannot fail,
 He rules o'er earth and heaven;
 The keys of death and hell
 Are to our Jesus given:

[V4]
 He sits at God's right hand
 Till all His foes submit,
 And bow to His command,
 And fall beneath His feet:
