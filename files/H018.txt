 Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
 Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
 As Thou hast been Thou for ever wilt be.

[C]
 Great is Thy faithfulness!
 Great is Thy faithfulness!
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;
 All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;
 Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

[V2]
 Summer and winter, and spring- time and harvest,
 Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
 Join with all nature in manifold witness,
 To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

[V3]
 Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
 Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
 Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
 Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
