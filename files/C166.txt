 Joy is the flag flown high from the castle of my heart,
 From the castle of my heart, from the castle of my heart,
 Joy is the flag flown high from the castle of my heart:
 For the King is in residence there.
 Let it fly in the sky, let the whole world know,
 Let the whole world know, let whole world know,
 Let it fly in the sky, let the whole world know,
 That the King is in residence there.
