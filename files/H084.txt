 While shepherds watched
 their flocks by night,
 All seated on the ground,
 The angel of the Lord came down,
 And glory shone around.

[V2]
 "Fear not," said he, for mighty dread
 Had seized their troubled mind;
 "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
 To you and all mankind."

[V3]
 "To you, in David's town, this day"
 Is born, of David's line,
 A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
 And this shall be the sign:

[V4]
 "The heavenly Babe you there shall find
 To human view displayed.
 All meanly wrapped in swathing bands
 And in a manger laid."

[V5]
 Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith
 Appeared a shining throng
 Of angels, praising God, who thus
 Addressed their joyful song:

[V6]
 "All glory be to God on high,
 And on the earth be peace;
 Good will henceforth from heaven to men
 Begin and never cease."
