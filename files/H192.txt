 Blessed Assurance-Jesus is mine!
 Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God;
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

[C]
 This is my story, this is my song,
 Praising my Saviour all the day long.

[V2]
 Perfect submission, perfect delight,
 Visions of rapture burst on my sight;
 Angels descending, bring from above
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

[V3]
 Perfect submission, all is at rest,
 I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
 Watching and waiting, looking above,
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
