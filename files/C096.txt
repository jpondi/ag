I am a debtor, Lord, a debtor for life
keep me from wasteful self and strife
B'Cause of the cross, O Lord, I owe you my all 
My sprit's moved by your tender call.
You have brought me I know, With your precious Blood
Timeless Calvary's Pleading love has stood
How can I draw back
And not be wholly Thine
Love and serve, nor call anything mine.
