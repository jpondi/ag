 Revive Thy work, O Lord!
 Thy mighty arm make bare;
 Speak with the voice that wakes the dead,
 And make Thy people hear!

[C]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord!
 While here to Thee we bow;
 Descend, O gracious Lord, descend!
 Oh, come, and bless us now!

[V2]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord!
 Exalt Thy precious Name!
 And may Thy love in every heart
 Be kindled to a flame!

[V3]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord!
 And bless to all Thy Word!
 And may its pure and sacred truth
 In living faith be heard!

[V4]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord!.
 Give Pentecostal showers!
 Be Thine the glory, Thine alone!
 The blessing, Lord, be ours!
