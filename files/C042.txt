 Come, God invites us to His feast, don't delay!
 Let's tell all the people
 whom we meet along the way.
 Come, God invites us!
 Keep it fixed in your mind,
 Why are you waiting?
 Come let's be going!
 Leave everything behind!

[V1]
 Living in darkness,
 without a purpose,
 Questions and doubts arise;
 Hatred and envy, bring only worry,
 Where will we find the light?
 In this frustration,
 Where hope has left us,
 We get a message true:
 Give up your mourning,
 Sorrow and sighing,
 Joy is awaiting you.

[V2]
 Search in the factories,
 And in the boutiques,
 Where people are so sad;
 Go to the highways,
 Go to the byways,
 Go and invite God's guests:
 Those who are working,
 Those who are rushing,
 Tell them the news of joy;
 Those who are sleeping,
 Those who are resting,
 Call to the feast of God.
