He became sin, who knew no sin (AR24.14)
That we might become his
righteousness
He humbled himself and carried
the cross

    Love so amazing, love so amazing
    Jesus messiah, name above all
    names
    Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel
    The rescue for sinners,
    the ransom from heaven
    Jesus messiah, lord of all

His body the bread
his blood the wine
Broken and poured out all for love
The whole earth trembled,
and the veil was torn
Love so amazing (2)

    All our hope is in you,
    all our hope is in you
    All the glory to you, God,
    the light of the world
