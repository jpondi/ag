1   Wonderful, so wonderful
    Is your unfailing love
    Your cross has spoken
    mercy over me
    No eye has seen no ear has heard
    No heart could fully know
    How glorious
    how beautiful you are

    Beautiful One I love you
    Beautiful One I adore
    Beautiful One my soul must sing

2   Powerful so powerful
    Your glory fills the skies
    Your mighty works displayed
    for all to see
    The beauty of your majesty
    Awakes my heart to sing
    How marvelous
    how wonderful you are

    You opened my eyes to your
    wonders anew
    You captured my heart
    with this love
    Because nothing on earth is as
    beautiful as you
