 I stand amazed in the presence
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,
 And wonder how He could love me,
 A sinner, condemned, unclean.

[C]
 How marvellous! How wonderful!
 And my song shall ever be:
 How marvellous! How wonderful!
 Is my Saviour's love for me!

[V2]
 For me it was in the garden
 He prayed: "Not my will, but Thine;"
 He had no tears for His own griefs,
 But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

[V3]
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
 He made them His very own;
 He bore the burden to Calvary,
 And suffered, and died alone.

[V4]
 When with the ransomed in glory
 His face I at last shall see,
 `Twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me.
