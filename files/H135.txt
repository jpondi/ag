 Jesus loves me this I know,
 For the Bible tells me so;
 Little ones to Him belong,
 They are weak, but He is strong.

[C]
 Yes, Jesus loves me,
 Yes, Jesus loves me,
 Yes, Jesus loves me,
 The Bible tells me so.

[V2]
 Jesus loves me! He who died
 Heaven's gate to open wide;
 He will wash away my sin,
 Let His little child come in.

[V3]
 Jesus loves me! loves me still,
 When I'm very weak and ill;
 From His shining throne on high
 Comes to watch me where I lie.

[V4]
 Jesus loves me! He will stay
 Close beside me all the way;
 If I love Him, when I die
 He will take me home on high.
