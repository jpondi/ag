 "We rest on Thee"- our Shield and our Defender!
 We go not forth alone against the foe;
 Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
 "We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go."

[V2]
 Yea, "in Thy Name," Captain of salvation!
 In Thy dear Name, all other names above;
 Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
 Our Prince of glory and our King of love.

[V3]
 "We go" in faith, our own great weakness feeling,
 And needing more each day Thy grace to know:
 Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
 "We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go."

[V4]
 "We rest on Thee"- our Shield and our Defender!
 Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise,
 When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,
 Victors-we rest with Thee, through endless days.
