Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you
None like you
Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's No one like you
None like you

Our God is greater, our God is
stronger
God You are higher than any
other
Our God is Healer, awesome
in power
Our God, Our God
