 Breathe on me, Breath of God
 Fill me with life anew,
 That I may love what Thou dost love
 And do what Thou wouldst do.

[V2]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God,
 Until my heart is pure;
 Until my will is one with Thine
 To do and to endure.

[V3]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God,
 Till I am wholly Thine;
 Until this earthly part of me
 Glows with Thy fire divine.

[V4]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God,
 So shall I never die,
 But live with Thee the perfect life,
 Of Thine eternity.
