 I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,
 Or to defend His cause,
 Maintain the honour of His Word,
 The glory of His cross.

[C]
 At the cross! at the cross!
 Where I first saw the light,
 And the burden of my heart rolled away:
 It was there by faith I received my sight,
 And now I am happy all the day!

[V2]
 Jesus, my God! I know His Name;
 His Name is all my trust;
 Nor will He put my soul to shame,
 Nor let, my hope be lost.

[V3]
 Firm as His throne His promise stands,
 And He can well secure
 What I've committed to His hands,
 Till the decisive hour.

[V4]
 Then will He own my worthless name
 Before His Father's face;
 And, in the New Jerusalem,
 Appoint my soul a place.
