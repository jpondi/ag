 Make way, make way,
 For Christ the King
 In splendour arrives
 Fling wide the gates and welcome Him
 Into your lives.

[C]
 Make way! make way!
 For King of kings! (2)
 Make way! make way!
 And let His Kingdom in!

[V2]
 He comes the broken hearts to heal
 The prisoners to free,
 The deaf shall hear
 The lame shall dance, the blind shall see.

[V3]
 And those who mourn with heavy hearts,
 Who weep and sigh;
 With laughter, joy and royal crown
 He'll beautify!

[V4]
 We call you now to worship Him
 As Lord of all,
 To have no gods before Him
 Their thrones must fall!
