 The Master hath come, and He calls us to follow
 The track of the footprints He leaves on our way;
 Far over the mountain, and through the deep hollow,
 The path leads us on to the mansions of day.

[C]
 The Master hath called us, the children who fear Him,
 Who march `neath Christ's banner, His own little band:
 We love Him, and seek Him, we long to be near Him,
 And rest in the light of His beautiful land.

[V2]
 The Master hath called us; the road may be dreary,
 And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
 But God's Holy Spirit shall comfort the weary-
 We follow the Saviour, and cannot turn back.

[C2]
 The Master hath called us: though doubt and temptation
 May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing,
 "Press onward, look upward," through much tribulation
 The children of Zion must follow their King.

[V3]
 The Master hath called us: in life's early morning
 With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
 We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,
 To cast in our lot with the people of God.

[C3]
 The Master hath called us, His sons and His daughters,
 We plead for His blessing, and trust in His love;
 And through the green pastures, beside the still waters,
 He'll lead us at last to His kingdom above.
