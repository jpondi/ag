 There's no other one so real to me as Jesus,
 No one to whom I'd rather go;
 There's no other one so real to me as Jesus,
 No other one can love me so.

[C]
 He takes away the fear,
 When days are dark and drear,
 He gives the peace of God above;
 There's no other one so real to me as Jesus,
 No other one can love me so.

[V2]
 When I'm sad and feeling blue I come to Jesus,
 He loves me when the teardrops start,
 There's no other one so real to me as Jesus,
 He lifts the burden from my heart.
