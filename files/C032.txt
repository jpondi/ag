 Bring a psalm to the Lord,
 From the Spirit and from His word.
 Lift your voice and rejoice,
 For our God is a mighty King,
 So come and clap your hands,
 Raise a shout,
 as we stand before the Lord,
 For the Lord is He,
 who has the pow'r to free,
 Who by His mighty arm gives strength and victory;
 So as we hail the King,
 then let His praises ring,
 And bring a psalm of joy before the Lord.
