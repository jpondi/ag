 When morning gilds the skies,
 My heart awaking cries,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Alike at work and prayer
 To Jesus I repair:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!

[V2]
 To Thee, My God above,
 I cry with glowing love,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 The fairest graces spring
 In hearts that ever sing,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!

[V3]
 Does sadness fill my mind?
 A solace here I find.
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Or fades my earthly bliss?
 My comfort still is this,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!

[V4]
 When evil thoughts molest,
 With this I shield my breast,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 The powers of darkness fear
 When this sweet chant they hear,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!

[V5]
 When sleep her balm denies,
 My silent spirit sighs,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 The powers of darkness fear
 When from the heart we say,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!

[V6]
 Be this while life is mine,
 My canticle divine,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Be this the eternal song
 Through all the ages on,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
