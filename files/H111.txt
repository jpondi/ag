 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 The strife is o'er, the battle done;
 The victory of life is won;
 The song of triumph has begun.
 Hallelujah!

[V2]
 The powers of death have done their worst,
 But Christ their legions hath dispersed;
 Let shouts of holy joy outburst;
 Hallelujah!

[V3]
 The three sad days have quickly sped:
 He rises glorious from the dead;
 All glory to our risen Head!
 Hallelujah!

[V4]
 He brake the bonds of death and hell;
 The bars from heaven's high portals fell;
 Let hymns of praise His triumph tell.
 Hallelujah!

[V5]
 Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee,
 From death's dread sting Thy servants free,
 That we may live, and sing to Thee
 Hallelujah!
