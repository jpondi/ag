 Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring;
 Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
 Standing on the promises of God.

[C]
 Stand...ing,...stand...ing,
 Standing on the promises of God my Saviour;
 Stand...ing,...stand...ing,
 I'm standing on the promises of God.

[V2]
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail;
 By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
 Standing on the promises of God.

[V3]
 Standing on the promises I now can see
 Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
 Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
 Standing on the promises of God.

[V4]
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
 Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
 Standing on the promises of God.

[V5]
 Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
 Listening every moment to the Spirit's call,
 Resting in my Saviour as my All-in-all,
 Standing on the promises of God.
