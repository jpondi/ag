 What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms;
 What a blessedness,
 What a peace is mine,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[C]
 Leaning, leaning,
 Safe and secure from all alarms;
 Leaning, leaning,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[V2]
 Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way
 Leaning on the everlasting arms;
 Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[V3]
 What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms;
 I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.
