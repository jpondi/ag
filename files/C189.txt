 Majesty, Worship His Majesty!
 Unto Jesus be all glory, power and praise!
 Majesty, Kingdom authority
 Flow from His Throne, unto His own, His anthem raise!
 
[V2]
 So exalt, lift up on high the Name of Jesus,
 Magnify, come glorify
 Christ Jesus the King!
[V3]
 Majesty, Worship His Majesty!
 Jesus who died, now glorified,
 King of all kings!
