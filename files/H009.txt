 Come, let us all unite to sing,
 God is love;
 Let heaven and earth their Praises bring,
 God is love;
 Let ev'ry soul from sin awake,
 Each in his heart sweet music make,
 And sing with us for Jesus' sake,
 For God is love.

[C]
 God is love! God is love!
 Come, let us all unite to sing
 That God is love.

[V2]
 Oh, tell to earth's remotest bound,
 God is love;
 In Christ we have redemption found,
 God is love;
 His blood has washed our sins away,
 His Spirit turned our night to day,
 And now we can rejoice to say,
 That God is love.

[V3]
 How happy is our portion here,
 God is love;
 His promises our spirits cheer,
 God is love;
 He is our Sun and Shield by day,
 Our help, our hope, our strength and stay,
 He will be with us all the way,
 Our God is love.
