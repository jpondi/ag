 O Lord,our Lord, how majestic
 Thy Name is
 How great is
 Thy Name in all the earth,
 Who has set Thy glory
 Above the high heavens
 And stilleth Thy foes through a child in it's birth.

[V2]
 When I think on Thy heavens the work of Thy fingers
 The moon and the stars which Thou has ordained
 What is man in Thy mem'ry a man that Thou mindest
 The son of man
 That Thou carest for him?

[V3]
 Thou hast made him but little lower than angels,
 And crowned him with
 honour and glory
 Thou gavest dominion o'er
 all of the wide earth
 And all of the creatures that
 run in the sea.
