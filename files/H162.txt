 Jesus calls us, o'er the tumult
 Of our life's wild, restless sea,
 Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
 Saying,"Christian, follow Me".

[V2]
 As of old apostles heard it
 By the Galilean lake,
 Turned from home and toil and kindred,
 Leaving all for His dear sake.

[V3]
 Jesus calls us, from the worship
 Of the vain world's golden store:
 From each idol that would keep us,
 Saying,"Christian, love Me more".

[V4]
 In our joys, and in our sorrows,
 Days of toil, and hours of ease,
 Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
 "Christian, love me more than these".

[V5]
 Jesus calls us, by Thy mercies,
 Saviour, may we hear Thy call;
 Give our hearts to Thy obedience,
 Serve and love Thee best of all.
