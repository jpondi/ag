 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardor
 Into the battle for truth.
 Jesus has set the example;
 Dauntless was He, young and brave;...
 Give Him your loyal devotion,
 Give HIm the best that you have....

[C]
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Clad in salvation's full armor,
 Join in the battle for truth.

[V2]
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Give Him first place in your heart;
 Give Him first place in your service,
 Consecrate every part.
 Give, and to you shall be given;
 God His beloved Son gave;...
 Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
 Give Him the best that you have....

[V3]
 Give of your best to the Master;
 Naught else is worthy His love;
 He gave Himself for your ransom,
 Gave up His glory above;
 Laid down His life without murmur,
 You from sin's ruin to save;...
 Give Him your heart's adoration,
 Give Him the best that you have....
