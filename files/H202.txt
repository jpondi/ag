 Christian, walk carefully, danger is near!
 On in thy journey with trembling and fear;
 Snares from without, and temptations within,
 Seek to entice thee once more into sin.

[C]
 Christian, walk carefully,
 Christian walk carefully,
 Christian, walk carefully, Danger is near!

[V2]
 Christian, walk cheerfully, through the fierce storm,
 Dark though the sky with its threats of alarm;
 Soon will the clouds and the tempest be o'er,
 Then with thy Saviour thou'lt rest evermore.
 Christian, walk cheerfully, through the fierce storm.

[V3]
 Christian, walk prayerfully; oft wilt thou fall,
 If thou forget on thy Saviour to call;
 Safe thou shalt walk through each trial and care,
 If thou art clad in the armour of prayer.
 Christian, walk prayerfully - fear lest thou fall.

[V4]
 Christian, walk hopefully; sorrow and pain
 Cease when the haven of rest thou shalt gain;
 Then from the lips of the Judge thy reward:
 "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."
 Christian, walk hopefully, rest thou shalt gain.
