 I owe everything, simply everything
 I owe everything to my Lord.
 I owe everything, every little thing
 I owe everything to my Lord.

[V1]
 My Lord loved me first
 He loved me long ago
 Long before I knew of Him,
 He had His eye on me,
 Before I was born, He loved me then
 And He loves me still.

[V2]
 I owe much to friends
 Who've encouraged me
 Helped and prayed for me on my way
 Yet I know those friends
 Are just one great part,
 Of the everything from my Lord.

[V3]
 Help me share it out,
 All you've given me
 With the world that I live in
 'Cause I can't hold it all,
 It's too much for me
 Help me share it out with my friends.
