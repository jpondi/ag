 O to be like Thee! Blessed Redeemer
 This is my constant longing and prayer;
 Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures,
 Jesus Thy perfect likeness to wear

[C]
 O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee,
 Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art!
 Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
 Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

[V2]
 O to be like Thee! Full of compassion,
 Loving, forgiving, tender and kind;
 Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,
 Seeking the wand'ring sinner to find.

[V3]
 O to be like Thee! LowIy, in spirit,
 Holy and harmless, patient and brave;
 Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
 Willing to suffer others to save.

[V4]
 O to be like Thee! Lord, I am corning
 Now to receive that anointing divine;
 All that I am and have I am bringing
 Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

[V5]
 O to be like Thee! While I am pleading,
 Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love;
 Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,
 Fit me for life and heaven above.
