Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Jesus gives me life
New life, he gives me this life is so great
(now ) me and jesus are mater
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I don’t want to lie no more
I don’t want to cheat no more
Blow this bad away-this new life is here to stay
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Jesus is good to me
He has forgiven me
He poured out his steadfast love in my heart
Love over flower from me
He gave me this love, to love everyone
He’s so wonderful tome
He poured out his spirit into my heart
Now I can love freely
