 Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
 There's mercy with the Lord;
 And He will surely give you rest
 By trusting in His Word.

[C]
 Only trust Him,Only trust Him,
 Only trust Him now,
 He will save you,
 He will save you !
 He will save you now!

[V2]
 For Jesus shed His precious blood,
 Rich blessings to bestow;
 Plunge now into the crimson flood
 That washes white as snow.

[V3]
 Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way
 That leads you into rest;
 Believe in Him without delay,
 And you are fully blest.

[V4]
 Come then, and join this holy band,
 And on to glory go,
 To dwell in that celestial land
 Where joys immortal flow.
