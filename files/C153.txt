 Jehovah Jireh, my Provider,
 Your grace is sufficient
 For me, for me, for me.
 Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
 Your grace is sufficient for me.
 My Lord shall supply all my needs
 According to His riches in glory;
 He'll give His angels charge over me,
 Jehovah Jireh cares for me, for me, for me,
 Jehovah Jireh cares for me.
