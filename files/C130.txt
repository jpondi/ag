 If any man come after me,
 Let him deny himself,
 Pick up his cross and follow Me
 Into Life eternally;
 Deny yourself, pick up the cross
 And follow Jesus,
 He is the Way, Truth and Life.

[C]
 Alleluia, praise the Lord
 Worship Him in one accord;
 Alleluia, He is King,
 Master, Lord of everything;
 Jesus Christ, Lord of all,
 Loving great and small,
 He is the Way, Truth and Life.
