 O day of rest and gladness,
 O day of joy and light,
 O balm of care and sadness,
 Most beautiful, most bright;
 On thee the high and lowly,
 Before the eternal throne,
 Sing Holy, Holy, Holy,
 To the great Three in One.

[V2]
 On thee, at the creation,
 The light first had its birth;
 On thee, for our salvation,
 Christ rose from depths of earth;
 On thee our Lord victorious
 The Spirit sent from heaven;
 And thus on thee most glorious
 A triple light was given.

[V3]
 Thou art a cooling fountain
 In life's dry, dreary sand,
 From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
 We view our promised land;
 A day of sweet reflection,
 A day of holy love,
 A day of resurrection
 From earth to things above.

[V4]
 Today on weary nations
 The heavenly manna falls,
 To holy convocations
 The silver trumpet calls.
 Where Gospel-light is glowing
 With pure and radiant beams,
 And living water flowing
 With soul-refreshing streams.

[V5]
 New graces ever gaining
 From this our day of rest,
 We reach the rest remaining
 To spirits of the blest.
 To Holy Ghost be praises,
 To Father and to Son;
 The Church her voice upraises
 To Thee, blest Three in One.
