 Low in the grave He lay -
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 Waiting the coming day -
 Jesus, my Lord!

[C]
 Up from the grave He arose,
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
 He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
 And He lives for ever with His saints to reign!
 He arose! He arose!
 Hallelujah! Christ arose!

[V2]
 Vainly they watch His bed -
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 Vainly they seal the dead -
 Jesus, my Lord!

[V3]
 Death cannot keep his prey -
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 He tore the bars away -
 Jesus, my Lord!
