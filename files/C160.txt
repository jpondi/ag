Jesus set the music singing,
Jesus made the shadows part;
jesus set the joy bells ringing,
Deep within my heart.

Now that my heart's in tune.
I know that some day soon
I'll join the angels in that 
Heavenly chourus up avobve,
For Jesus set music singing.
Jesus made the shadows part;
Jesus set the joy bells ringing.
Deep within my heart.
