 Fight the good fight with all thy might!
 Christ is thy strength and Christ thy right;
 Lay hold on life, and it shall be
 Thy joy and crown eternally.

[V2]
 Run the straight race through God's good grace,
 Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;
 Life with its way before us lies,
 Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.

[V3]
 Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;
 His boundless mercy will provide;
 Lean, and thy trusting soul shall prove
 Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

[V4]
 Faint not, nor fear, for He is near,
 He changeth not, and thou art dear;
 Only believe, and thou shalt see
 That Christ is all in all to thee.
