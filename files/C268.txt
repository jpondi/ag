 Though the fig tree does not blossom
 And there be no fruit on the vines;
 The produce of the olive fails
 And the fields yield no food,
 Tho' the flock be cut off from the fold
 And there be no herd in the stalls,
 Yet will I rejoice in the Lord
 Yet will I rejoice in the Lord
 I will joy in the God of my salvation
 God the Lord is my strength.
