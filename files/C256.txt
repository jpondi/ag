 There is a Redeemer,
 Jesus, God's own Son,
 Precious Lamb of God,
 Messiah, Holy One.

[C]
 Thank you O my Father, for giving us Your Son
 And leaving Your Spirit, till The work on earth is done.

[V2]
 Jesus my Redeemer,
 Name above all names,
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
 O for sinners slain.

[V3]
 When I stand in glory,
 I will see his face,
 And there I'll serve my King forever
 In that Holy place.
