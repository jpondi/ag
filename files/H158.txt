 Hark my soul! It is the Lord;
 `Tis Thy Saviour, hear His word;
 Jesus speaks and speaks to thee,
 "Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?"

[V2]
 "I delivered thee when bound,
 And, when bleeding,healed thy wound;
 Sought thee wandering, set thee right,
 Turned thy darkness into light."

[V3]
 "Mine is an unchanging love,
 Higher than the heights above;
 Deeper than the depths beneath:
 Free and faithful, strong as death."

[V4]
 "Thou shalt see My glory soon,
 When the work of grace is done;
 Partner of My throne shalt be;
 Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?"

[V5]
 Lord! It is my chief complaint
 That my love is weak and faint;
 Yet I love Thee, and adore:
 Oh, for grace to love Thee more!
