 Don't build your house on the sandy Land---
 Don't build it too near the shore;
 Well, it might look kind of nice,
 But you'll have to build it twice,
 Oh! you'll have to build your house once more.
 You better build your house upon a rock;
 Make a good foundation on a solid spot,
 Oh, the storms may come and go
 But the peace of God you will know.
