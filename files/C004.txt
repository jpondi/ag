 Accept my broken, my broken spirit Lord,
 Accept my contrite, my contrite heart.
 Accept my broken, my broken spirit Lord,
 Accept my contrite, my contrite heart.

[V1]
 I know I've been wrong for so long
 And so I'm singing this song.
 'Cause when I come with a broken spirit
 I know that You Oh Lord, will receive it.

[V2]
 Sometimes my heart becomes as stone
 Sometimes my will becomes my own
 This time I come with a broken spirit
 And know that You, Oh Lord, will receive it.
