 Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
 That saved a wretch like me!
 I once was lost, but now am found,
 Was blind, but now I see.

[V2]
 `Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 And grace my fears relieved;
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed!

[V3]
 Thro' many dangers, toils and snares,
 I have already come:
 `Tis grace that bro't me safe thus far,
 And grace will lead me home.

[V4]
 When we've been there ten thousand years,
 Bright shining as the sun
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
 Than when we first began.
