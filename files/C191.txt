 Make my life to be,
 Like a melody,
 Ever sounding out the message of the cross;
 Saviour let me be,
 Live a melody,
 Ever sounding out in days of gain or loss.
 With Jesus in my heart, no discord can arise,
 He can make the saddest heart to harmonize.
 Saviour, let me be,
 Live a melody,
 Ever sounding out the message of the Cross.
