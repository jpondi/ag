 Make me a captive, Lord,
 And then I shall be free;
 Force me to render up my sword,
 And I shall conq'ror be.
 I sink in life's alarms
 When by myself I stand;
 Imprison me within Thine arms,
 And strong shall be my hand.

[V2]
 My heart is weak and poor
 Until it Master find:
 It has no spring of action sure,
 It varies with the wind:
 It cannot freely move
 Till Thou hast wrought its chain,
 Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
 And deathless it shall reign.

[V3]
 My power is faint and low
 Till I have learned to serve:
 It wants the needed fire to glow,
 It wants the breeze to nerve;
 It cannot drive the world
 Until itself be driven;
 Its flag can only be unfurled
 When Thou shalt breathe from Heaven.

[V4]
 My will is not my own
 Till Thou hast made it Thine;
 If it would reach the monarch's throne
 It must its crown resign:
 It only stands unbent
 Amid the clashing strife
 When on Thy bosom it has leant,
 And found in Thee its life.
