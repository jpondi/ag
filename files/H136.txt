 Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
 Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
 Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
 Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to save.

[C]
 Rescue the perishing,
 Care for the dying;
 Jesus is merciful,
 Jesus will save.

[V2]
 Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
 Waiting the penitent child to receive:
 Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
 He will forgive if they only believe.

[V3]
 Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
 Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
 Touched by a loving hand, wakened by kindness,
 Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.

[V4]
 Rescue the perishing, duty demands it
 Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide:
 Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
 Tell the poor wanderers a Saviour has died.
