 For me to live is Christ to die is gain,
 To hold His hand and walk His narrow way,
 There is no peace
 No joy no thrill
 Like walking in His will,
 For me to live is Christ to die is gain.

[V1]
 Now once my heart was full of sin and shame
 Till someone told me Jesus came to save
 Then He said,'come home to me'
 He set my poor heart free;
 For me to live is Christ to die is gain

[V2]
 Now there are things which I still do not know
 But of this one thing I'm completely sure
 He who called me on that day
 Washed all my sins away;
 For me to live is Christ to die is gain
