 God is here, and that to bless us
 With the Spirit's quickening power!
 See, the cloud, already bending,
 Waits to drop the grateful shower.

[C]
 Let it come... O Lord, we pray Thee
 Let the shower... of blessing fall;
 We are wait...ing, we are waiting
 Oh, revive... the hearts of all!

[V2]
 God is here, we feel His presence
 In this consecrated place;
 But we need the soul-refreshing
 Of His free, unbounded grace.

[V3]
 God is here, oh, then believing,
 Bring to Him our one desire,
 That His love may now be kindled,
 Till its flame each heart inspire.

[V4]
 Saviour, grant the prayer we offer,
 While in simple faith we bow;
 From the windows of Thy mercy
 Pour us out a blessing now.
