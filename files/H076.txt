 It came upon the midnight clear,
 That glorious song of old,
 From angels bending near the earth
 To touch their harps of gold:
 Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
 From heaven's all-gracious King!
 The world in solemn stillness lay
 To hear the angels sing.

[V2]
 Still through the cloven skies they come
 With peaceful wings unfurled;
 And still their heavenly music floats
 O'er all the weary world:
 Above its sad and lowly plains
 They bend on hovering wing,
 And ever, o'er its Babel-sounds,
 The blessed angels sing.

[V3]
 O ye, beneath life's crushing load
 Whose forms are bending low,
 Who toil along the climbing way
 With painful steps and slow;
 Look up! for glad and golden hours
 Come swiftly on the wing;
 Oh, rest beside the weary road,
 And hear the angels sing!

[V4]
 For lo! the days are hastening on,
 By prophet-bards foretold,
 When, with the ever-circling years,
 Comes round the age of gold;
 When peace shall over all the earth
 Its ancient splendours fling,
 And the whole world send back the song
 Which now the angels sing!
