 There's a call comes ringing o'er the restless wave,
 "Send the light,... send, the light!"
 There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,
 "Send the light... send the light!"...

[C]
 Let it shine... from shore to shore!...
 Send the light,... the blessed gospel light!
 Let it shine forever more!

[V2]
 We have heard the Macedonian call today,
 "Send the light,... send the light!"
 And our grateful off'rings at the cross we lay,
 "Send the light,... send the light!"...

[V3]
 May the grace of Jesus unto all abound,
 "Send the light,... send the light!"
 And a Christ-like spirit ev'rywhere be found,
 "Send the light,... send the light!"...

[V4]
 Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
 "Send the light,... send the light!"
 While we gather jewels for our crown above,
 "Send the light,... send the light!"...
