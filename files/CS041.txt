Sing, sing, sing (AR24.5)
And make music with the heavens
We will sing, sing, sing
Grateful that You hear us
When we shout Your praise
Lift high the name of Jesus
What's not to love about You?
Heaven and Earth adore You
Kings and kingdoms bow down
Son of God, You are the one
You are the one

You are the love that frees us
You are the light that leads us
Like a fire burning
Son of God, you are the one
You are the one we're living for

Supplement 2024 song 5
