Greatest day in History
Death was beaten you have
rescued me
Sing it out Jesus is alive

The empty cross the empty grave
Life eternal You have won the day
Shout it out Jesus is alive
He's alive

    Oh happy day, happy day
    You washed my sin away
    Oh happy day, happy day
    I'll never be the same
    Forever I am changed

When I stand in that place
Free at last meet him face to face
I am Yours Jesus You are mine

Endless joy perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate Jesus is alive
He's alive
