 I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,
 Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more;
 But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry,
 From the waters lifted me, now safe am I

[C]
 Love lifted me, love lifted me,
 When nothing else could help, love lifted me;
 Love lifted me, love lifted me,
 When nothing else could help, love lifted me.

[V2]
 All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I'll cling,
 In His blessed presence live, ever His praises sing.
 Love so mighty and so true merits my soul's best songs;
 Faithful, loving service too to Him belongs.

[V3]
 Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves;
 He will lift you by His love out of the angry waves.
 He's the Master of the sea, billows His will obey;
 He your Saviour wants you to be saved today.
