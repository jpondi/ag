 Hark! the herald angels sing,
 "Glory to the new-born King!
 Peace on earth and mercy mild
 God and sinners reconciled."
 Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
 Join the triumph of the skies;
 With the angelic host proclaim,
 "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

[C]
 Hark! The herald angels sing,
 "Glory to the new-born king!"

[V2]
 Hail, the heaven-born
 Prince of Peace!
 Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
 Light and life to all He brings,
 Risen with healing in His wings.
 Mild He lays His glory by,
 Born that man no more may die;
 Born to raise the sons of earth
 Born to give them second birth.

[V3]
 Come, Desire of nations, come
 Fix in us Thy humble home;
 Rise, the woman's conquering Seed,
 Bruise in us the serpent's head:
 Sing we then, with angels sing,
 "Glory to the new-born King!
 Glory in the highest heaven,
 Peace on earth, and sins forgiven."
