 Thine be the glory, risen conqu'ring Son
 Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death has won.
 Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away;
 Kept the folded grave clothes where Thy body lay.

[C]
 Thine be the glory, risen conqu'ring Son
 Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death has won.

[V2]
 Lo, Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb!
 Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom
 Let the church with gladness Hymns of triumph sing;
 For her Lord now liveth, Death hath lost its sting.

[V3]
 No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life;
 Life is naught without Thee, Aid us in our strife;
 Make us more than conquerors, Through Thy deathless love;
 Lead us in Thy triumph to Thy home above.
