 Good Christian men, rejoice and sing!
 Now is the triumph of our King!
 To all the world glad news we bring:
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[V2]
 The Lord of life is risen for aye;
 Bring the flowers of song to strew his way;
 Let all mankind rejoice and say:
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[V3]
 Praise we in songs of victory
 That love, that life which cannot die,
 And sing with hearts uplifted high:
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[V4]
 Thy name we bless, O risen Lord,
 And sing today with one accord
 The life laid down, the life restored:
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
