1.  Even though I walk through the valley
    Of the shadow of death
    Your perfect love is casting out fear
    And even when I'm caught in
    the middle
    Of the storms of this life
    I won't turn back I know You are near

        And I will fear no evil
        For my God is with me
        And if my God is with me
        Whom then shall I fear (2)

        Oh no You never let go
        Through the calm and through
        the storm
        Oh no You never let go
        In every high and every low
        Oh no You never let go
        Lord You never let go of me

2.  And I can see a light that is coming
    For the heart that holds on
    A glorious light beyond all compare
    And there will be an end to
    these troubles
    But until that day comes
    We'll live to know You here on
    the earth
