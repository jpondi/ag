 Thank you for the cross Lord
 Thank you for the price You paid
 Bearing all my sin and shame
 In love You came
 And gave amazing grace
 Thank you for this love Lord
 Thank you for the nail pierced hands
 Wash(ed) me in Your cleansing flow
 Now all I know Your forgiveness and embrace

[C]
 Worthy is the Lamb
 Seated on the throne
 Crown You now with many crowns
 You reign victorious
 High and lifted up
 Jesus Son of God
 The darling of Heaven crucified
 Worthy is the Lamb. (2)
