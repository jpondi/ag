 All my lifelong I had panted
 For a drink from some cool spring,
 That I hoped would quench the burning
 Of the thirst I felt within.

[C]
 Hallelujah! I have found Him
 Whom my soul so long has craved!
 Jesus satisfies my longings;
 Through His blood I now am saved.

[V2]
 Feeding on the husks around me
 Till my strength was almost gone,
 Longed my soul for something better,
 Only still to hunger on.

[V3]
 Poor I was, and sought for riches,
 Something that would satisfy;
 But the dust I gathered round me
 Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

[V4]
 Well of water, ever springing,
 Bread of life, so rich and free,
 Untold wealth that never faileth,
 My Redeemer is to me.
