 Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
 However dark it be;
 Lead me by Thine own hand,
 Choose Thou the path for me.

[V2]
 Smooth let it be or rough,
 It will be still the best:
 Winding or straight, it leads
 Right onward to Thy rest.

[V3]
 I dare not choose my lot;
 I would not if I might;
 Choose Thou for me, my God,
 So shall I walk aright.

[V4]
 Take Thou my cup, and it
 With joy or sorrow fill,
 As best to Thee may seem:
 Choose Thou my good or ill.

[V5]
 Choose Thou for me my friends,
 My sickness or my health:
 Choose Thou my cares for me,
 My poverty or wealth.

[V6]
 Not mine, not mine the choice,
 In things or great or small:
 Be Thou my Guide, my Strength,
 My Wisdom and my All.
