 Do you wonder why it is I *love Him?
 I *love Him, I *love Him?
 Do you wonder why it is I *love Him?
 I will gladly tell you why.
 It's because He left His Home in glory to die for me,
 This is why I cannot help but *love Him,
 Jesus Christ, who died for me.

[V2]
 Do you wonder...I *trust Him...

[V3]
 Do you wonder...I *serve Him...

[V4]
 Do you wonder...I *praise Him...
