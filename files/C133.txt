 If you love me
 keep my commandments
 If you love me keep them true
 If you love me keep my commandments
 Not forgetting the old or new.

[V1]
 On the mountain Sinai,
 God gave Moses ten great laws,
 To be kept by His own people
 Throughout time.
 Then came Jesus on the scene,
 With one new great law of love,
 Knowing love would bring the best
 From us, He said.

[V2]
 Now then Jesus could have said,
 You must do this or do that,
 But instead He left us choice to prove our love.
 Though sometimes if we but could,
 We would change the laws of God,
 But the words of Jesus echo in our minds.
