 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
 Doth his successive journeys run;
 His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
 Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

[V2]
 For him shall endless prayer be made,
 And princes throng to crown His head:
 His name like sweet perfume shall rise
 With every morning sacrifice.

[V3]
 People and realms of every tongue
 Dwell on His love with sweetest song:
 And infant voices shall proclaim
 Their early blessings on His Name.

[V4]
 Blessings abound where'er He reigns;
 The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,
 The weary find eternal rest,
 And all the sons of want are blest.

[V5]
 Let every creature rise and bring.
 Peculiar honours to our king:
 Angels descend with songs again,
 And earth repeat the loud Amen!
