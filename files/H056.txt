 The king of love my Shepherd is,
 Whose goodness faileth never;
 I nothing lack if I am His,
 And He is mine forever.

[V2]
 Where streams of living water flow
 My ransomed soul He leadeth,
 And, where the verdant pastures grow,
 With food celestial feedeth.

[V3]
 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
 But yet in love He sought me,
 And on His shoulder gently laid,
 And home rejoicing brought me.

[V4]
 In death's dark vale I fear no ill
 With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
 Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
 Thy cross before to guide me.

[V5]
 Thou spread'st a table in my sight;
 Thy unction grace bestoweth:
 And oh, what transport of delight
 From Thy pure chalice floweth!

[V6]
 And so through all the length of days
 Thy goodness faileth never;
 Good Shepherd,may I sing Thy praise
 Within Thy house forever!
