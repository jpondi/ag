 I need Thee every hour,
 Most gracious Lord;
 No tender voice like Thine
 Can peace afford.

[C]
 I need Thee, oh, I need Thee!
 Every hour I need Thee:
 Oh, bless me now, my Saviour!
 I come to Thee.

[V2]
 I need Thee every hour:
 Stay Thou near by;
 Temptations lose their power
 When Thou art nigh.

[V3]
 I need Thee every hour,
 In joy or pain;
 Come quickly and abide,
 Or life is vain.

[V4]
 I need Thee every hour;
 Teach me Thy will;
 And Thy rich promises,
 In me fulfil.

[V5]
 I need Thee every hour,
 Most Holy One;
 Oh, make me Thine indeed,
 Thou blessed Son!
