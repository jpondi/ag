 "Fear not, I am with thee";
 Blessed golden ray,
 Like a star of glory,
 Lighting up my way!
 Through the clouds of midnight
 This bright promise shone,
 "I will never leave thee,
 Never will leave thee alone."

[C]
 No, never alone;
 No, never alone;
 He promised never to leave me,
 Never to leave me alone.

[V2]
 Roses fade around me,
 Lilies bloom and die,
 Earthly sunbeams vanish---
 Radiant still the sky!
 Jesus, Rose of Sharon,
 Blooming for His own,
 Jesus, heaven's sunshine,
 Never will leave me alone.

[V3]
 Steps unseen before me,
 Hidden dangers near;
 Nearer still my Saviour,
 Whispering, "Be of cheer."
 Joys, like birds of spring-time,
 To my heart have flown,
 Singing all so sweetly,
 "He will not leave me alone."
