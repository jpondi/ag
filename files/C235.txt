 Sing with me hallelujahs,
 Sing with me a song of praise;
 For in thanking there is blessing,
 Let us sing our grateful praise.

[V1]
 For the rest during the night,
 For the sunshine full and bright
 For the air that we can breathe so freely.

[V2]
 For the change He wrought in us
 Through the wonder of the Cross
 When He died that we may ever live.

[V3]
 From the dead He rose again
 Satan's forces having slain
 That we all may live in victory.
