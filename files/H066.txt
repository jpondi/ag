 How I praise Thee, precious Saviour,
 That Thy love laid hold of me;
 Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me,
 That I might Thy channel be.
 
[C]
 Channels only, blessed Master,
 But with all Thy wondrous power
 Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
 Every day and every hour.
 
[V2]
 Just a channel, full of blessing,
 To the thirsty hearts around;
 To tell out Thy full salvation,
 All Thy loving message sound.
 
[V3]
 Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,
 A clean vessel in Thine hand;
 With no power but as Thou givest
 Graciously with each command.
[V4]
 Witnessing Thy power to save me,
 Setting free from self and sin;
 Thou hast bought me to possess me:
 In Thy fulness, Lord, come in.
 
[V5]
 Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit
 Hearts that full surrender know;
 That the streams of living water
 From our inner man may flow.
