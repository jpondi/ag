 I know not why God's wondrous grace
 To me hath been made known;
 Nor why---unworthy as I am---
 He claimed me for His own.

[C]
 But "I know whom I have believed; and am
 Persuaded that He is able to keep that which I've
 committed unto Him against that day."

[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith
 To me He did impart;
 Or how believing in His Word
 Wrought peace within my heart.

[V3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves,
 Convincing men of sin;
 Revealing Jesus through the Word
 Creating faith in Him.

[V4]
 I know not what of good or ill
 May be reserved for me
 Of weary ways or golden days,
 Before His face I see.

[V5]
 I know not when my Lord may come
 I know not how, nor where;
 If I shall pass the vale of death,
 Or "meet Him in the air."
