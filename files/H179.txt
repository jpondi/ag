 O Happy day! that fixed my choice,
 On Thee, my Saviour and my God!
 Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
 And tell its raptures all abroad.

[C]
 Happy day! happy day!
 When Jesus washed my sins away!
 He teaches me to watch and pray;
 And live rejoicing every day!
 Happy day! Happy day!
 When Jesus washed my sins away!

[V2]
 'Tis done! the great transaction's done!
 I am my Lord's and He is mine;
 He drew me, and I followed on;
 Charmed to confess the voice divine.

[V3]
 Now rest, my long-divided heart;
 Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;
 Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
 With Him of every good possessed.

[V4]
 High heaven that heard the solemn vow,
 That vow renewed shall daily hear;
 Till in life's latest hour I bow,
 And bless in death a bond so dear.
