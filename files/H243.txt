 How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
 Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
 What more can He say than to you He hath said,
 You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

[V2]
 "In every condition-in sickness, in health
 In poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth;
 At home and abroad, on the land, on the sea,
 As thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be."

[V3]
 "Fear not I am with thee, oh, be not dismayed!
 For I am thy God and will still give thee aid:
 I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
 Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand."

[V4]
 "When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
 My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
 The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
 Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine."

[V5]
 "The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
 I will not, I will not, desert to its foes;
 That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake,
 I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake!"
