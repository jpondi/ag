 Christ has for sin atonement made:
 What a wonderful Saviour!
 We are redeemed! the price is paid!
 What a wonderful Saviour!

[C]
 What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!
 What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord!

[V2]
 I praise Him for the cleansing blood:
 What a wonderful Saviour!
 That reconciled my soul to God;
 What a wonderful Saviour!

[V3]
 He dwells within me day by day:
 What a wonderful Saviour!
 And keeps me faithful all the way:
 What a wonderful Saviour!

[V4]
 He gives me overcoming power:
 What a wonderful Saviour!
 And triumph in each conflict hour:
 What a wonderful Saviour!

[V5]
 To Him I've given all my heart:
 What a wonderful Saviour!
 The world shall never share a part:
 What a wonderful Saviour!
