We bow our hearts (AR24.4)
We bend our knees
Oh Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes
From evil things
Oh Lord we cast down our idols

    So give us clean hands
    And give us pure hearts
    Let us not lift our souls to another
    (repeat)
    Oh God let us be
    A generation that seeks
    Who seeks Your face, Oh God of Jacob
    (repeat)

Supplement 2024 song 4
