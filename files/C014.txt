 And I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
 And I'm accepted
 You were condemned
 And I'm alive and well
 Your Spirit is within me
 Because You died and rose again
 Amazing love, how can it be
 That You my King would die for me
 Amazing love, I know it's true
 It's my joy to honour You
 In all I do, I'll honour You.
