 Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus Christ our Lord. (repeat)

[V1]
 For He won the battle over death and evil,
 Yes, He did, We know He did.
 He can still deliver in the day of trouble,
 Yes, He can,
 We know He can.

[V2]
 Since our future victory is guaranteed,
 Be strong and steady, very steady.
 Do continue to abound in all God's work,
 For nothing's wasted, nothing's wasted.
