 Oh, teach me what it meaneth
 That cross uplifted high,
 With One - the Man of Sorrows--
 Condemned to bleed and die!
 Oh, teach me what it cost Thee
 To make a sinner whole;
 And teach me, Saviour, teach me
 The value of a soul!

[V2]
 Oh, teach me what it meaneth
 That sacred crimson tide -
 The blood and water flowing
 From Thine own wounded side.
 Teach me that if none other
 Had sinned, but I alone,
 Yet still, Thy blood, Lord Jesus,
 Thine only, must atone.

[V3]
 Oh, teach me what it meaneth -
 Thy love beyond compare,
 The love that reacheth deeper
 Than depths of self-despair!
 Yea, teach me, till there gloweth
 In this cold heart of mine
 Some feeble, pale reflection
 Of that pure love of Thine.

[V4]
 Oh, teach me what it meaneth,
 For I am full of sin
 And grace alone can reach me,
 And love alone can win.
 Oh, teach me, for I need Thee,
 I have no hope beside -
 The chief of all the sinners
 For whom the Saviour died!

[V5]
 O infinite Redeemer!
 I bring no other plea,
 Because Thou dost invite me
 I cast myself on Thee.
 Because Thou dost accept me
 I love and I adore;
 Because Thy love constraineth,
 I'll praise Thee evermore!
