 Oh, Breath of Life, come sweeping through us,
 Revive Thy Church with life and power;
 Oh! Breath of Life, come cleanse, renew us,
 And fit Thy Church to meet this hour.

[V2]
 Oh! Wind of God, come bend us, break us,
 Till humbly we confess our need;
 Then in Thy tenderness remake us
 Revive, restore, for this we plead.

[V3]
 Oh! Breath of Love, come breathe within us,
 Renewing thought and will and heart;
 Come, Love of Christ, afresh to win us,
 Revive Thy Church in every part.

[V4]
 Revive us, Lord! is zeal abating
 While harvest fields are vast and white?
 Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting,
 Equip Thy Church to spread the light.
