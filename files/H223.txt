 He leadeth me! Oh blessed thought!
 Oh, words with heavenly comfort fraught!
 Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
 Still `tis God's hand that leadeth me!

[C]
 He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
 By His own hand He leadeth me!
 His faithful follower I would be;
 For by His hand He leadeth me!

[V2]
 Sometimes `mid scenes of deepest gloom,
 Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
 By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
 Still `tis His hand that leadeth me!

[V3]
 Lord, I would place my hand in Thine,
 Nor ever murmur nor repine;
 Content, whatever lot I see,
 Since `tis my God that leadeth me.

[V4]
 And when my task on earth is done,
 When by Thy grace, the victory's won,
 E'en death's cold wave I will not flee;
 Since Thou through Jordan leadest me.
