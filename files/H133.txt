 I heard an old, old story,
 How a Saviour came from glory,
 How He gave His life on Calvary
 To save a wretch like me.
 I heard about His groaning,
 Of His precious blood's atoning,
 Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.

[C]
 O, victory in Jesus,
 My Saviour forever,
 He sought me and bought me,
 With His redeeming blood.
 He loved me ere I knew Him,
 And all my love is due Him,
 He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood.

[V2]
 I heard about His healing,
 Of His cleansing power revealing,
 How He made the lame to walk again,
 And caused the blind to see:
 And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
 Come and heal my broken spirit:"
 And somehow Jesus came and brought -
 To me the victory.

[V3]
 I heard about a mansion
 He's built for me in glory,
 And I heard about the streets of gold
 Beyond the crystal sea.
 About the angels singing
 And the old redemption's story,
 And some sweet day I'll sing
 Up there, `The Song of Victory.'
