I was weary and tired with sins dark ways,
And helplessly lost I could see;
But with joy was amazed, as at Calv'ry I gazed,
There was grace enough left there for me.
I cried unto Jesus and bowed to His will
The joy of His sprit, my heart then did fill;
And worder of wonders!
O sinner, 'tis true,
there is grace enough left there for you.
