 The head that once was crowned with thorns
 Is crowned with glory now:
 A royal diadem adorns
 The mighty Victor's brow.

[V2]
 The highest place that heav'n affords
 Is His by sovereign right:
 The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
 He reigns in perfect light.

[V3]
 The joy of all who dwell above,
 The joy of all below,
 To whom He manifests His love,
 And grants His Name to know.

[V4]
 To them the cross, with all its shame,
 With all its grace, is given:
 Their name, an everlasting name;
 Their joy, the joy of heaven.

[V5]
 They suffer with their Lord below:
 They reign with Him above;
 Their profit and their joy to know
 The fulness of His love.

[V6]
 His cross to them is life and health,
 Though it was death to Him;
 Their present hope, and joy, and wealth,
 And their eternal theme.
