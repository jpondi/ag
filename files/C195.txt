 Mountains of mercies,
 Fountains of grace,
 These are the bounties,
 Uplifting my soul
 Treasures so awesome in Jesus I find
 Cheap pleasures so fleeting
 I firmly forsake.
 Can I leave Jesus for rubbish so vile?
 My Saviour's so precious,
 I shall not grieve Him
 Till life's trials are over,
 I'll always be true
 Jesus my treasure
 The world's so much junk.
