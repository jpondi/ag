 Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, And His righteousness,
 And all these things shall be added unto you
 Hallelu, Hallelujah.

[C]
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelu, Hallelujah.

[V2]
 Men shall not live by bread alone, But by every word
 That proceeds from the mouth of God
 Hallelu, Hallelujah.

[V3]
 Ask, and it shall be given unto you, Seek and you shall find;
 Knock and it shall be opened unto you
 Hallelu, Hallelujah.
