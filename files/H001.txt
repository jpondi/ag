 All hail the power of Jesus' Name!
 Let angels prostrate fall;
 Bring forth the royal diadem,
 And crown Him Lord of all.

[V2]
 Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
 Who from the altar call,
 Extol the stem of Jesse's rod
 And crown Him Lord of all.

[V3]
 Ye saints redeemed of Adam's race,
 Ye ransomed from the fall,
 Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
 And crown Him Lord of all.

[V4]
 Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
 The wormwood and the gall;
 Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
 And crown Him Lord of all.

[V5]
 Let every kindred, every tribe,
 On this terrestrial ball,
 To Him all majesty ascribe,
 And crown Him Lord of all.

[V6]
 Oh, that with yonder sacred throng
 We at His feet may fall;
 Join in the everlasting song,
 And crown Him Lord of all.
