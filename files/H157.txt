 Have you any room for Jesus-
 He who bore your load of sin?
 As He knocks and asks admission,
 Sinner, will you let Him in?

[C]
 Room for Jesus, King of glory!
 Hasten now, His word obey!
 Swing the heart's door widely open!
 Bid Him enter while you may!

[V2]
 Room for pleasure, room for business;
 But for Christ, the crucified,
 Not a place that He can enter,
 In the heart for which He died!

[V3]
 Have you any time for Jesus,
 As in grace He calls again?
 Oh "TODAY" is "time accepted"
 Tomorrow you may call in vain.

[V4]
 Room and time now give to Jesus,
 Soon will pass God's day of grace;
 Soon thy heart be cold and silent,
 And thy Saviour's pleadings cease.
