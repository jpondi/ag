 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
 Just to take Him at His Word,
 Just to rest upon His promise,
 Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord"

[C]
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
 O, for grace to trust Him More!

[V2]
 How I love to trust in Jesus,
 Just to trust His cleansing blood,
 Just in simple faith to plunge me
 'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

[V3]
 Yes, I've learned to trust in Jesus
 And from sin and self to cease,
 Now from Jesus simply taking,
 Life and rest and joy and peace.

[V4]
 I'm so glad I learned to trust Him,
 Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend,
 And I know that He is with me,
 He'll be with me to the end.
