 There's no greater name than Jesus,
 Name of Him who came to save us,
 In that saving Name of Jesus ev'ry knee shall bow.
 Let ev'rything that is `neath the ground,
 Let ev'rything in the world around,
[V2]
 Let ev'rything that is high o'er the sky,
 Bow at Jesus Name---
 In our minds by faith professing,
 In our hearts by inward blessing,
 On our tongues by word confessing,
 Jesus Christ is Lord!
