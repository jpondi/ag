 Oh, spread the tidings round, wherever man is found,
 Wherever human hearts and human woes abound;
 Let ev'ry Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:
 The Comforter has come!

[C]
 The Comforter has come, the Comforter has come!
 The Holy Ghost from heav'n, the
 Father's promise giv'n;
 Oh, spread the tidings round, wherever man is found:
 The Comforter has come!

[V2]
 The long, long night is past, the morning breaks at last;
 And hush'd the dreadful wail and fury of the blast,
 As o'er the golden hills the day advances fast:
 The Comforter has come!

[V3]
 The mighty King of kings, with healing in His wings,
 To ev'ry captive soul a full deliv'rance brings;
 And thro' the vacant cells the song of triumph rings:
 The Comforter has come!

[V4]
 Oh, boundless love Divine! how shall this tongue of mine
 To wondering mortals tell the matchless grace Divine--
 That I may with Him dwell, and in His image shine!--
 The Comforter has come!

[V5]
 Oh, let the echoes fly above the vaulted sky,
 And all the saints above to all below reply
 In strains of endless love, the song that ne'er will die:
 The Comforter has come!
