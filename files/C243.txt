 Thank you, Lord Jesus,
 That I can freely speak
 With you, my God
 Thank you, Lord Jesus,
 My prayer is heard by you.

[V1]
 All my griefs and all my sorrows,
 All my worries, all my fears,
 All my pain and all my conflicts,
 Lord, I bring with tears.

[V2]
 Every joy and every blessing
 Lord, I bring to you in prayer;
 Through your faithfulness alone
 I see this loving care.

[V3]
 I can bring you all the problems
 I could tell nobody else
 For dear Lord, you understand me,
 You're my closest friend
