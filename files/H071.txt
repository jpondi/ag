 As with gladness men of old
 Did the guiding star behold,
 As with joy they hailed its light,
 Leading onward, beaming bright,
 So, most gracious Lord, may we
 Evermore be led to Thee.

[V2]
 As with joyful steps they sped,
 Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,
 There to bend the knee before
 Thee whom heaven and earth adore:
 So may we with willing feet
 Ever seek the mercy seat.

[V3]
 As they offered gifts most rare
 At Thy cradle rude and bare,
 So may we with holy joy,
 Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
 All our costliest treasures bring,
 Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

[V4]
 Holy Jesus, every day
 Keep us in the narrow way,
 And, when earthly things are past,
 Bring our ransomed souls at last
 Where they need no star to guide,
 Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
