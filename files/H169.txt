 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 "Come unto Me and rest:
 Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
 Thy head upon My breast:"
 I came to Jesus as I was.
 Weary, and worn, and sad,
 I found in Him a resting-place,
 And He has made me glad.

[V2]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 "Behold, I freely give
 The living water- thirsty one,
 Stoop down, and drink, and live:"
 I came to Jesus, and I drank
 Of that life-giving stream;
 My thirst was quenched, My soul revived,
 And now I live in Him.

[V3]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 "I am this dark world's Light;
 Look unto Me: thy morn shall rise,
 And all thy day be bright:"
 I looked to Jesus, and I found
 In Him my Star, my Sun;
 And in that light of life I'll walk,
 Till travelling days are done.
