I will feast at the table of the Lord (2) (AR25.1) 
I won't hunger anymore 
At His table

Come all you weary; come and find 
His yoke is easy; His burden light 
He is able; He will restore
At the table of the Lord

There is peace at the table of the Lord (2)
I won't worry anymore
At His table

There is healing at the table of the Lord (2)
I won't suffer anymore
At His table

I know He has a place for me 
Oh, what joy will fill my heart 
With the saints around the mercy 
seat of God
