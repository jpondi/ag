 Down at the Cross where my Saviour died,
 Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
 There to my heart was the blood applied;
 Glory to His name.

[C]
 Glory to His name. Glory to His name
 There to my heart was the blood applied;
 Glory to His name.

[V2]
 I am so wondrously saved from sin,
 Jesus so sweetly abides within;
 There at the cross where He took me in;
 Glory to His name.

[V3]
 Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
 I am so glad I have entered in;
 There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
 Glory to His name.

[V4]
 Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;
 Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet;
 Plunge in today, and be made complete;
 Glory to His name.
