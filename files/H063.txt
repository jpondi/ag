 All to Jesus I surrender,
 All to Him I freely give;
 I will ever love and trust Him,
 In His presence daily live.

[C]
 I surrender all, I surrender all;
 All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all.

[V2]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Humbly at his feet I bow;
 Wordly pleasures all forsaken,
 Take me, Jesus, take me now.

[V3]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
 Let the Holy Spirit witness
 I am Thine and Thou art mine.

[V4]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Lord, I give myself to Thee;
 Fill me with Thy love and power,
 Let Thy blessing rest on me.

[V5]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Now I feel the sacred flame!
 Oh, the joy of full salvation!
 Glory, glory to His Name.
