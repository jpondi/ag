 Drinking at the springs of living water,
 Happy now am I, my soul they satisfy;
 Drinking at the springs of living water,
 O wonderful and bountiful supply!

[V1]
 I thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame,
 And nothing satisfying there I found;
 But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came,
 Where springs of living water did abound.

[V2]
 How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
 It makes me glad and happy all the way;
 Now glory, grace and blessing mark the path I've trod,
 I'm shouting "Hallelujah" ev'ry day.

[V3]
 O sinner, won't you come today to Calvary?
 A fountain there is flowing deep and wide;
 The Saviour now invites you to the water free,
 Where thirsting spirits can be satisfied.
