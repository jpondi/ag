 If you want joy, real joy, wonderful joy,
 Let Jesus come into your heart.
 If you want joy, real joy, wonderful joy
 Let Jesus come into your heart.
 Your sins He'll wash away,
 Your night He'll turn today,
 Your life He'll make it over anew.
 If you want joy, real joy, wonderful joy,
 Let Jesus come into your heart.
