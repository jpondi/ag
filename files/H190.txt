 A pilgrim was I, and a wand'ring,
 In the cold night of sin I did roam,
 When Jesus the kind Shepherd found me,
 And now I am on my way home.

[C]
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
 All the days, all the days of my life;
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
 All the days, all the days of my life.
 And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
 And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
 All the days, all the days of my life.

[V2]
 He restoreth my soul when I'm weary,
 He giveth me strength day by day,
 He leads me beside the still waters,
 He guards me each step of the way.

[V3]
 When I walk thru the dark lonesome valley,
 My Saviour will walk with me there;
 And safely His great hand will lead me
 To the mansions He's gone to prepare.
