My God is awesome
He can move mountains
Keep me in the valley
Hide me from the rain

My God is awesome
Heals me when I'm broken
Gives strength where I've been
weakened
Forever He will reign

My God is awesome
awesome, awesome,
awesome

My God is awesome
Savior of the whole world
Giver of salvation
By His stripes I am healed

My God is awesome
Today I am forgiven
His grace is why I'm living
Praise His holy name

He's mighty [x4]

He's holy [x4]
