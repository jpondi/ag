 Meekness and majesty
 Manhood and Deity,
 In perfect harmony,
 The man who is God.
 Lord of eternity
 Dwells in humanity,
 Kneels in humility
 And washes our feet.

[C]
 O what a mystery
 Meekness and majesty,
 Bow down and worship
 For this is your God.

[V2]
 Father's pure radiance,
 Perfect in innocence,
 Yet learns obedience
 To death on a cross.
 Suffering to give us life,
 Conquering through sacrifice,
 And as they crucify
 Prays: "Father forgive."

[V3]
 Wisdom unsearchable
 God the invisible
 Love indestructible
 In frailty appears
 Lord of Infinity
 Stooping so tenderly
 Lifts our humanity
 To the heights of His throne.
