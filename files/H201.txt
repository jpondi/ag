 "Be of good courage," God spake unto Joshua,
 When o'er the river God pointed the way,
 Jordan uncrossable! things seemed impossible,
 Waters divide as they march and obey.

[C]
 Got any rivers you think are uncrossable?
 Got any mountains you can't tunnel through?
 God specializes in things thought impossible,
 He does the things others cannot do.

[V2]
 Battles to win! they would meet with their obstacles,
 Jericho's walls, too, must fall to the ground,
 God never failed; he stood back of His promises,
 Walls had to crumble as they march around.

[V3]
 God is the same and His Word is dependable;
 He'll make a way through the waters for you.
 Life's situations by Him are amendable,
 Mountains and hills He will part for you too.
