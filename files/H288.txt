1.  Oh to see the dawn
    Of the darkest day
    Christ on the road to Calvary
    Tried by sinful men
    Torn and beaten then
    Nailed to a cross of wood

        This the power of the cross
        Christ became sin for us
        Took the blame bore the wrath
        We stand forgiven at the cross

2.  Oh to see the pain
    Written on Your face
    Bearing the awesome weight of sin
    Every bitter thought
    Every evil deed
    Crowning Your bloodstained brow

3.  Now the daylight flees
    Now the ground beneath
    Quakes as it's Maker bows His head
    Curtain torn in two
    Dead are raised to life
    Finished the victory cry

4.  Oh to see my name
    Written in the wounds
    For through Your suffering I am free
    Death is crushed to death
    Life is mine to live
    Won through Your selfless love
    
        This the power of the cross
        Son of God slain for us
        What a love what a cost
        We stand forgiven at the cross
