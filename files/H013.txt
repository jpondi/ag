 Fairest Lord Jesus,
 Lord of all creation,
 Jesus, of God and man the Son;
 You will I cherish,
 You will I honour,
 You are my soul's delight and crown.

[V2]
 Fair are the rivers,
 Meadows and forests
 Clothed in the fresh green robes of Spring;
 Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
 He makes the saddest heart to sing.

[V3]
 Fair is the sunrise,
 Starlight and moonlight
 Spreading their glory across the sky;
 Jesus shines brighter,
 Jesus shines clearer,
 Than all the heavenly host on high.

[V4]
 All fairest beauty,
 Heavenly and earthly,
 Jesus, my Lord, in You I see;
 None can be nearer,
 Fairer or dearer,
 Than you, my Saviour, are to me.
