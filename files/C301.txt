 You are my strength when I am weak
 You are the treasure that I seek
 You are my all in all,
 Seeking You as a precious Jewel
 Lord to give up I'd be a fool
 You are my all in all.

[C]
 Jesus Lamb of God
 Worthy is Your Name
 Jesus Lamb of God
 Worthy is Your Name

[V2]
 Taken my cross, my sin, my shame
 Rising again, I bless Your Name
 You are my all in all.
 When I fall down, You pick me up
 Whenever dry, You fill my cup
 You are my all in all.
