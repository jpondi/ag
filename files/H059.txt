 "There shall be showers of blessing:"
 This is the promise of love:
 There shall be seasons refreshing,
 Sent from the Saviour above.

[C]
 Showers of blessing,
 Showers of blessing we need;
 Mercy drops round us are falling,
 But for the showers we plead.

[V2]
 "There shall be showers of blessing:"
 Precious reviving again;
 Over the hills and the valleys,
 Sound of abundance of rain.

[V3]
 "There shall be showers of blessing:"
 Send them upon us, O Lord:
 Grant to us now a refreshing;
 Come and now honour Thy word.

[V4]
 "There shall be showers of blessing:"
 Oh, that today they might fall,
 Now as to God we're confessing,
 Now as on Jesus we call!
