 Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness
 Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eves,
 Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping
 We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

[C]
 Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
 We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
 Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
 We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

[V2]
 Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
 Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
 By and by the harvest and the labour ended
 We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

[V3]
 Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
 Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
 When our weeping's over He will bid us welcome
 We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
