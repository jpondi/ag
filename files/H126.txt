 There is a Redeemer, Jesus, God's own Son,
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.

[C]
 Thank You, O my Father, for giving us Your Son,
 And leaving Your Spirit till the work on earth is done.

[V2]
 Jesus my Redeemer, Name above all names,
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, O for sinners slain.

[V3]
 When I stand in glory I will see His face.
 And there I'll serve my King for ever in that Holy place.
