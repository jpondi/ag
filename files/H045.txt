 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
 My great Redeemer's praise:
 The glories of my God and King,
 The triumphs of His grace.

[V2]
 My gracious Master and my God,
 Assist me to proclaim,
 And spread through all the earth abroad
 The honours of Thy Name.

[V3]
 Jesus, the Name that charms our fears,
 That bids our sorrows cease;
 'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
 'Tis life and health and peace.

[V4]
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
 He sets the prisoner free;
 His blood can make the foulest clean
 His blood availed for me.

[V5]
 He speaks, and listening to His voice
 New life the dead receive,
 The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
 The humble poor believe.

[V6]
 Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, Ye dumb,
 Your loosened tongues employ;
 Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
 And leap, ye lame, for joy.
