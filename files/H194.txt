 Lord, I come beforeYour throne of grace,
 I find rest in Your presence and fullness of joy;
 In worship and wonder I behold your face,
 Singing what a faithful God have I!

[C]
 What a faithful God have I!
 What a faithful God!
 What a faithful God have I!
 Faithful in everyway!

[V2]
 Lord, of mercy You have heard my cry,
 Through the storm You're the beacon, My song in the night;
 In the shelter of Your wings hear my hearts reply ,
 Singing what a faithful God have I!

[V3]
 Lord all Sovereign granting peace from Heaven,
 Let me comfort those who suffer, with the comfort You have given;
 I will tell of Your great love for as long as I live,
 Singing what a faithful God have I!
