 Cheer up for I have overcome (3)
 I have overcome the world.

[V1]
 In this world you will have trouble and sorrow,
 In this world you will be tested and tried;
 Don't forget My words before I left you
 Let them cheer you up, in you abide.

[V2]
 Don't give up, when facing some sad tomorrow;
 Don't give up when feeling heartsick, denied.
 Think of me remember how much I love you,
 Find in me your peace, in Me abide.
