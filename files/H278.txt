 Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
 Sing His mercy and His grace
 In the mansions bright and blessed
 He'll prepare for us a place!

[C]
 When we all get to heaven
 What a day of rejoicing that will be!
 When we all see Jesus,
 We'll sing and shout the victory.

[V2]
 While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
 Clouds will overspread the sky
 But when travelling days are over,
 Not a shadow not a sigh!

[V3]
 Let us then be true and faithful
 Trusting, serving everyday
 Just one glimpse of Him in glory,
 Will the toils of life repay!

[V4]
 Onward to the prize before us
 Soon His beauty we'll behold
 Soon the pearly gates will open
 We shall tread the streets of gold!
