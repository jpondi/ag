 My God can do anything, anything, yes, anything
 My God can do anything, yes, anything,
 He made the earth with all its fulness,
 And all that time shall bring
 My God can do anything, yes anything.
 My God controls the wind and weather,
 He sends the sunshine and the rain,
 He holds this universe together,
 With love He rules His great domain;
 He understands each little heartache,
 He even knows the pain you bear,
 And He will get ne'er too busy
 To give an answer to your prayer.
