1.  I cast my mind to Calvary (AR.2)
    Where Jesus bled and died for me
    I see His wounds, His hands,
    His feet
    My Saviour on that cursed tree

2.  His body bound and drenched in tears
    They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
    The entrance sealed by heavy stone
    Messiah still and all alone

        O praise the Name of the Lord
        our God
        O praise His Name forevermore
        For endless days we will sing
        Your praise
        Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

3.  Then on the third at break of dawn
    The Son of heaven rose again
    O trampled death where is your sting?
    The angels roar for Christ the King

4.  He shall return in robes of white
    The blazing sun shall pierce the night
    And I will rise among the saints
    My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
