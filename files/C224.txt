 Purify my heart
 Let me be as gold and precious silver
 Purify my heart
 Let me be as gold, pure gold

[C]
 Refiner's fire, my hearts one desire
 Is to be holy, set apart for You Lord
 I choose to be holy, set apart for You my Master
 Ready to do Your will.

[V2]
 Purify my heart
 Cleanse me from within
 And make me holy
 Purify my heart
 Cleanse me from my sin, deep within.
