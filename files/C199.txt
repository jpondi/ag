 My Jesus, My Saviour
 Lord there is none like You
 All of my days I want to praise the wonders of Your mighty love
 
[V2]
 My comfort, my shelter tower of refuge and strength
 Let every breath all that I am never cease to worship You.
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing
 Power and Majesty praise to the King
 
[V3]
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
 At the sound of Your Name.
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands,
 Forever I'll love You forever I'll stand,
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You.
