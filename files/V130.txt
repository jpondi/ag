I'm going to run, run, run 
to see my Jesus, (3) 
When He comes, when He comes.

    1. Every head shall bow before Him (3) 
When He comes. (2)
    2. Every eye shall behold Him (3) 
When He comes. (2)
    3. Every tongue shall confess Him (3) 
When he comes. (2)
    4. Every knee shall kneel before Him (3) 
When He comes (2)
