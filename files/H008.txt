 Christ triumphant, ever reigning,
 Saviour, Master, King,
 Lord of heav'n our lives sustaining,
 Hear us as we sing:

[C]
 Yours the glory and the crown,
 The high renown,
 The eternal Name.

[V2]
 Word incarnate truth revealing,
 Son of Man on earth,
 Power and majesty concealing
 By Your humble birth.

[V3]
 Suffering servant, scorned, ill-treated,
 Victim crucified,
 Death is through the cross defeated
 Sinners justified.

[V4]
 Priestly King, enthroned for ever
 High in heaven above,
 Sin and death and hell shall never
 Stifle hymns of love.

[V5]
 So, our hearts and voices raising
 Through the ages long,
 Ceaselessly upon You gazing
 This shall be our song.
