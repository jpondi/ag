I love you, Lord    (AR24.9)
Oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been held in Your
hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
I will sing of the goodness of God

    All my life You have been faithful
    All my life You have been so, so
    good
    With every breath that I am able
    I will sing of the goodness of God

I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest night
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
I have lived in the goodness of God

    Your goodness is running after
    It's running after me (2)
    With my life laid down
    I'm surrendered now
    I give You everything
    Your goodness is running after
    It's running after me
