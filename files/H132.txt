 Hark! the voice of Jesus crying:
 "Who will go and work today?"
 Fields are white and harvest waiting;
 "Who will bear the sheaves away?"
 Loud and strong the Master calleth,
 Rich reward He offers thee;
 Who will answer, gladly saying,
 "Here am I; send me, send me"?
 
[V2]
 If you cannot speak like angels,
 If you cannot preach like Paul,
 You can tell the love of Jesus,
 You can say He died for all.
 If you cannot rouse the wicked
 With the Judgment's dread alarms,
 You can lead the little children
 To the Saviour's waiting arms.
 
[V3]
 If, among the older people,
 You may not be apt to teach,
 "Feed My lambs," said Christ our Shepherd,
 "Place the food within their reach."
 And it may be that the children
 You have led with trembling hands
 Will be found among your jewels
 When you reach the better land.
 
[V4]
 Let none hear you idly saying,
 "There is nothing I can do."
 While the souls of men are dying,
 And the Master calls for you.
 Take the task He gives you gladly,
 Let His work your pleasure be;
 Answer quickly when He calleth,
 "Here am I: send me, send me!"
