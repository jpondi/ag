 Come, Thou Almighty King,
 Help us Thy name to sing, help us to praise:
 Father, all glorious, o'er all victorious,
 Come and reign over us, Ancient of Days.

[V2]
 Come, Thou Incarnate Word,
 Gird on Thy mighty sword, our prayer attend
 Come and Thy people bless,
 And give Thy word success
 Spirit of holiness, on us descend.

[V3]
 Come, Holy Comforter,
 Thy sacred witness bear in this glad hour:
 Thou who almighty art, now rule in every heart,
 And ne'er from us depart, Spirit of pow'r.

[V4]
 To the great One in Three
 Eternal praises be, hence evermore:
 His sov'reign majesty may we in glory see,
 And to eternity love and adore.
