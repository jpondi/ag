 My faith looks up to Thee,
 Thou Lamb of calvary,
 Saviour Divine:
 Now hear me while I pray,
 Take all my guilt away,
 Oh, let me from this day
 Be wholly Thine!

[V2]
 May Thy rich grace impart
 Strength to my fainting heart,
 My zeal inspire;
 As Thou hast died for me,
 Oh, may my love to Thee
 Pure warm, and changeless be,
 A living fire!

[V3]
 When life's dark maze I tread,
 And griefs around me spread,
 Be Thou my Guide
 Bid darkness turn to day,
 Wipe sorrow's tears away,
 Nor let me ever stray
 From Thee aside.

[V4]
 When ends life's transient dream,
 When death's cold, sullen stream,
 Shall o'er me roll;
 Blest Saviour, then in love
 Fear and distrust remove;
 Oh, bear me safe above,
 A ransomed soul.
