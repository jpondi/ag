 Jesus, Jesus, this is my song
 Jesus, Jesus, the whole day long,
 He is mine, a Saviour divine,
 Praise His Holy Name.
 
[V1]
 All the way my Lord is leading me
 Praise His Name! (2)
 With His heav'nly manna feeding me
 Praise His Holy Name.
 
[V2]
 When I faint, His grace upholdeth me
 Praise His Name! (2)
 When I fear, His arms enfoldeth me
 Praise His Holy Name.
