 Lord, speak to me that I may speak
 In living echoes of Thy tone;
 As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
 Thy erring children, lost and lone.

[V2]
 Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead
 The wandering and the wavering feet;
 Oh, feed me, Lord, that I may feed
 Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

[V3]
 Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand
 Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee,
 I may stretch out a loving hand
 To wrestlers with the troubled sea!

[V4]
 Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach
 The precious things Thou dost impart;
 And wing my words, that they may reach
 The hidden depths of many a heart.

[V5]
 Oh, give Thine own sweet rest to me,
 That I may speak with soothing power,
 A word in season, as from Thee,
 To weary ones in needful hour.

[V6]
 Oh, fill me with Thy fulness, Lord
 Until my very heart o'erflow
 In kindling thought and glowing word,
 Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

[V7]
 Oh, use me, Lord, use even me,
 Just as Thou wilt, and when,and where
 Until Thy blessed face I see,
 Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
