 I love the thrill that I feel when
 I get together with,
 God's wonderful people;
 Love the thrill that I feel
 when I get together with,
 God's wonderful people;
 What a sight just to see all the happy faces,
 Praising God in heavenly places,
 What a thrill that I feel when I get together with
 God's wonderful people.
