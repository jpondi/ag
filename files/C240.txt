 Teach me, Lord, to wait
 down on my knees
 'Til in your own good time
 you answer my pleas.
 Teach me not to rely on
 what others do,
 But to wait in prayer for an
 answer from you.

[C]
 "They that wait upon the
 Lord shall renew their strength;
 They shall mount up with wings as eagles;
 They shall run and not be weary;
 They shall walk and not faint."
 Teach me Lord, Teach me Lord, to wait.

[V2]
 Teach me, Lord, to wait
 while hearts are aflame,
 Let me humble my pride,
 and call on your name.
 Keep my faith renewed, my
 eyes on Thee,
 Let me be on this earth,
 what you want me to be.
