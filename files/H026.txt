 Jesus, the Name high over all,
 In hell, or earth, or sky;
 Angels and men before it fall,
 And devils fear and fly.

[V2]
 Jesus, the Name to sinners dear,
 The Name to sinners given;
 It scatters all their guilty fear,
 It turns their hell to heaven.

[V3]
 Jesus, the prisoner's fetters breaks,
 And bruises Satan's head;
 Power into strengthless souls it speaks,
 And life into the dead.

[V4]
 Oh, that the world might taste and see
 The riches of His grace!
 The arms of love that compass me
 Would all mankind embrace.

[V5]
 His only righteousness I show,
 His saving truth proclaim:
 `Tis all my business here below
 To cry, "Behold the Lamb!"

[V6]
 Happy, if with my latest breath
 I may but gasp His Name:
 Preach Him to all, and cry in death;
 "Behold, behold the Lamb!"
