 With harps and with vials there stand a great throng
 In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song:

[C]
 Unto Him who hath loved us and washed us from sin,
 Unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.

[V2]
 All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight;
 Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite:

[V3]
 He maketh the rebel a priest and a king;
 He hath bought us, and taught us this new song to sing:

[V4]
 How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been
 If he never had loved us till cleansed from our sin!

[V5]
 Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,
 So that others, believing, this new song shall sing.
