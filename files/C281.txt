 We're gathered here
 Because we all love Jesus
 We're in this place to glorify His Name;
 Our hearts reach out to touch the Living God
 Because we love the Lord We're gathered here today.

[V2]
 We're gathered here
 To sing our songs and hymns of praise
 We're in this place to hear the Word of God;
 Our minds reach out, O fill them with your thoughts, Lord,
 Because we love the Lord We're gathered here today.
