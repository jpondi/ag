 Lord, I am fondly, earnestly longing
 Into Thy holy likeness to grow;
 Thirsting for more and deeper communion,
 Yearning Thy love more fully to know.

[C]
 Open the wells of grace and salvation,
 Pour the rich streams deep into my heart;
 Cleanse and refine my tho't and affection,
 Seal me and make me pure as Thou art.

[V2]
 Dead to the world would I be, O Father,
 Dead unto sin, alive unto Thee;
 Crucify all the earthly within me,
 Emptied of sin and self may I be.

[V3]
 I would be Thine, and serve Thee for ever,
 Filled with Thy Spirit, lost in Thy love;
 Come to my heart, Lord, come with anointing,
 Showers of grace send down from above.
