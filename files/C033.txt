 Built for You, O Lord, my King
 Fit me in everything;
 To be Your dwelling place
 Humbly I plead for grace.

[C]
 Though made in Your likeness
 I have no real fitness;
 Make me a vessel meet
 Lord, I fall at Your feet.
 Cleans'd thro' with Holy burnings
 Then borne on Angel wings;
 At Thy holy footstool
 What a place for a fool!
