 Love the Lord your God, with all your heart,
 And all your soul and all your mind
 And love all of mankind
 As you would love yourself and
 Love, the Lord Your God with all your heart
 And all your soul as you would love yourself and
 We've got, Christian lives to live
 We've got, Jesus' love to give
 We've got nothing to hide,
 Because in Him we abide.
