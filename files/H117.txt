 When the morning breaks, and when I awake
 This my prayer would be:
 Lord, today I would ask of Thee
 More like Jesus that I should be.

[C]
 I would be like Jesus,
 Only by His grace,
 More and more like Jesus
 'Til I see Him face to face.

[V2]
 Through each day as I work and play;
 His word commands me to be
 Doing always the things that only will
 To Him bring the glory.

[V3]
 Then when everyone sings that happy song
 We will join with them too,
 'Til at last when Jesus does arrive,
 We will go with Him too.

[C2]
 Oh! to be like Jesus,
 Walking hand in hand
 To be like Jesus
 'Til I see Him face to face.
