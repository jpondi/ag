 For I'm persuaded to believe
 Nothing can seperate us
 From the wonderful love of God;
 For above it will send us
 If we let Him live within us
 While in the simple world we trod;
 Neither height nor depth, nor principalities
 Things present, or things to come,
 Though the devil hate us he can never seperate us
 From the wonderful love of God
