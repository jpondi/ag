 Love Divine, so great and wondrous,
 Deep and mighty, pure, sublime;
 Coming from the heart of Jesus-
 Just the same through tests of time.

[C]
 He the pearly gates will open, So that I may enter in;
 For He purchased my redemption, And forgave me all my sin.

[V2]
 Like a dove when hunted, frightened,
 As a wounded fawn was I;
 Broken-hearted, yet He healed me-
 He will heed the sinner's cry.

[V3]
 Love Divine, so great and wondrous-
 All my sins He then forgave,
 I will sing His praise for ever,
 For His blood, His pow'r to save.

[V4]
 In life's eventide, at twilight,
 At His door I'll knock and wait;
 By the precious love of Jesus,
 I shall enter heaven's gate.
