 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,
 I will sing! I will sing!
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
 [V2]
 With my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness,Thy faithfulness.
 With my mouth will I make known
 Thy faithfulness to all generations.
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever
 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
