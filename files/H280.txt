 When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,
 And time shall be no more,
 And the monring breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
 When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,
 And the roll is call'd up yonder, I'll be there.

[C]
 When the roll...is called up yon..der
 When the roll...is called up yon..der
 When the roll...is called up yon..der
 When the roll...is called up yon..der
 I'll be there.

[V2]
 On that bright and cloudless morning,
 When the dead in Christ shall rise,
 And the glory of His resurrection share;
 When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,
 And the roll is call'd up yonder, I'll be there.

[V3]
 Let me labour for the Master
 From the dawn till setting sun,
 Let me talk of all His wondrous love and care;
 Then, when all of life is over, and my work on earth is done,
 And the roll is call'd up yonder, I'll be there.
