 Mine eyes have seen the glory
 Of the coming of the Lord;
 He is trampling out the vintage
 Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
 He hath loosed the fateful lightning
 Of his terrible swift sword;
 His truth is marching on.

[C]
 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
 His truth is marching on.

[V2]
 He has sounded forth the trumpet
 That shall never call retreat;
 He is sifting out the hearts of men
 Before his judgment seat;
 O be swift, my soul, to answer him,
 Be jubilant, my feet!
 Our God is marching on.

[V3]
 In the beauty of the lilies
 Christ was born across the sea,
 With a glory in his bosom
 That transfigures you and me.
 As he died to make men holy,
 Let us die to make men free!
 While God is marching on.

[V4]
 He is coming like the glory
 Of the morning on the wave;
 He is wisdom to the mighty,
 He is honour to the brave;
 So the world shall be his footstool,
 And the soul of wrong his slave.
 Our God is marching on.
