 Must I go - and empty-handed?
 Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
 Not one day of service give Him,
 Lay no trophy at His feet?

[C]
 Must I go - and empty - handed?
 Must I meet my Saviour so?
 Not one soul with which to greet Him:
 Must I empty-handed go?

[V2]
 Not at death I shrink or falter,
 For my Saviour saves me now;
 But to meet Him empty-handed,
 Thought of that now clouds my brow.

[V3]
 Oh, the years of sinning wasted,
 Could I but recall them now,
 I would give them to my Saviour
 To His will I'd gladly bow.

[V4]
 Up,ye saints, arouse, be earnest!
 Up, and work while yet `tis day:
 Ere the night of death o'ertake you:
 Strive for souls while yet you may.
