 Jesus use me, and please don't refuse me
 Surely there's a work that I can do
 Even tho' it's humble, help my will to crumble
 Though the task be great, I'll work for you.

[V1]
 Dear Lord, I'll be your witness
 If you'll help my weakness,
 I know that I'm not worthy, Lord, of Thee;
 By eyes of faith I see Thee,
 Upon the Cross of Calvary,
 I cry, dear Lord, let me Thy servant be.

[V2]
 He's the Lily of the valley,
 He's the Bright and Morning Star,
 The Fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
 He's the beauiful Rose of Sharon,
 He's all the world to me,
 I love Him and I want the world to know.
