 Jesus stand among us
 At the meeting of our lives,
 Be our sweet agreement
 At the meeting of our eyes,

[C]
 O Jesus, we love You
 So we gather here,
 Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.

[V2]
 So to You we're gathering
 Out of each and every land,
 Christ the love between us
 At the joining of our hands.
