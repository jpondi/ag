 Jesus keep me near the Cross;
 There a precious fountain,
 Free to all- a healing stream-
 Flows from Calvary's mountain.

[C]
 In the cross, In the cross,
 Be my glory ever;
 Till my raptured soul shall find
 Rest beyond the river.

[V2]
 Near the Cross,a trembling soul,
 Love and mercy found me;
 There the Bright and Morning Star,
 Shed its beams around me.

[V3]
 Near the cross, O Lamb of God,
 Bring its scenes before me;
 Help me walk from day to day,
 With its shadow o'er me.

[V4]
 Near the Cross I'll watch and wait,
 Hoping, trusting ever,
 Till I reach the golden strand,
 Just beyond the river.
