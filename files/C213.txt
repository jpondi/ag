 O sing unto the Lord a new song
 For He has done marvellous things
 His right hand and His holy arm hath gotten Him the victory.
 The Lord has made known His salvation
 His righteousness has
 He openly showed,in the sight of the heathen:
 O sing unto the Lord a new song
 He has remembered His mercy and His truth to all the house of Israel.
 All the ends of the earth hath seen, the salvation of our God.
