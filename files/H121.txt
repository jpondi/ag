 Once again the Gospel message,
 From the Saviour you have heard;
 Will you heed the invitation?
 Will you turn and seek the Lord?

[C]
 Come believing! come believing!
 Come to Jesus! look and live!
 Come believing! come believing!
 Come to Jesus! look and live!

[V2]
 Many summers you have wasted,
 Ripened harvests you have seen;
 Winter snows by Spring have melted,
 Yet you linger in your sin.

[V3]
 Jesus for your choice is waiting;
 Tarry not: at once decide!
 While the Spirit now is striving,
 Yield, and seek the Saviour's side.

[V4]
 Cease of fitness to be thinking;
 Do not longer try to feel;
 It is trusting, and not feeling,
 That will give the Spirit's seal.

[V5]
 Let your will to God be given,
 Trust in Christ's atoning blood;
 Look to Jesus now in heaven,
 Rest on His unchanging word.
