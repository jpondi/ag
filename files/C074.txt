 God is good all the time
 He put a song of praise
 In this heart of mine
 God is good all the time,
 Through the darkest night
 His light will shine
 God is good, God is good,
 All the time
 
[V1]
 If you're walking through the valley
 There are shadows all around.
 Do not fear He will guide you
 He will keep you safe and sound
 He has promised to never leave you
 Nor forsake you, and His word is true.
 
[V2]
 We were sinners so unworthy,
 Still for us He chose to die,
 He filled us with His Holy spirit,
 Now we can stand and testify,
 That His love is everlasting,
 And His mercies they will never end.
