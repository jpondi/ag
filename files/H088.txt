 I gave my life for thee,
 My precious blood I shed,
 That thou might'st ransomed be,
 And quickened from the dead:
 I gave My life for thee;
 What hast thou given for me?

[V2]
 I spent long years for thee
 In weariness and woe,
 That an eternity
 Of joy thou mightest know:
 I spent long years for thee;
 Hast thou spent one for me?

[V3]
 My Father's home of light,
 My rainbow-circled throne,
 I left for earthly night,
 For wanderings sad and lone:
 I left it all for thee;
 Hast thou left aught for Me?

[V4]
 I suffered much for thee,
 More than thy tongue can tell
 Of bitter agony
 To rescue thee from hell:
 I suffered much for thee;
 What canst thou bear for Me?

[V5]
 Lord let my life be given,
 And every moment spent,
 For God, for souls for heaven,
 And all earth's ties be rent.
 Thou gav'st Thyself for me,
 Now I give all for Thee.
