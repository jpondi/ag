 Acres of diamonds, Mountains of gold,
 Rivers of silver, jewels untold;
 All these together wouldn't buy you or me
 Peace when we're sleeping, a conscience that's free.
 A heart that's contented, a satisfied mind;
 These are the treasures money can't buy:
 If you have Jesus, there's more wealth in your soul,
 Than acres of diamonds and mountains of gold.
