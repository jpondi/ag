 God holds the key of all unknown, And l am glad:
 If other hands should hold the key,
 Or if He trusted it to me, I might be sad.

[V2]
 What if tomorrow's cares were here Without its rest?
 I'd rather He unlocked the day,
 And, as the hours swing open, say, "My will is best."

[V3]
 The very dimness of my sight Makes me secure;
 For, groping in my misty way,
 I feel His hand; I hear Him say, "My help is sure."

[V4]
 I cannot read His future plans; But this I know:
 I have the smiling of His face,
 And all the refuge of His grace, While here below.

[V5]
 Enough: this covers all my wants; And so I rest!
 For what I cannot, He can see,
 And in His care I saved shall be, For ever blest.
