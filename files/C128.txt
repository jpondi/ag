 I've gotta be like a tree planted by the water
 Trusting in the Father to keep me strong
 I've gotta be like a tree planted by the water
 Trusting in the name of the Lord.
 I've gotta be like a tree planted by the water
 Trusting in the Father to help me grow
 I've gotta be like a tree planted by the water
 Trusting in the name of the Lord.

[C]
 The deeper the roots go, the better the fruits grow
 The blessings bloom out for all to see
 The deeper the roots go, the more my life shows
 That Jesus is the Lord of me.
 (Repeat chorus and verse)

[V2]
 I've gotta be like a tree planted by the water
 Trusting in the Father to keep me strong
 I've gotta be like a tree planted by the water
 Trusting in the name of the Lord.
 Trusting in the name of the Lord.
 Trusting in the name of the Lord.
 Trusting in the name of the Lord.
