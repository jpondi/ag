 Lift Him up! lift Him up!
 Lift the Name of Jesus higher
 Lift Him up! raise his banner to the sky,
 He said: "if I be lifted up,
 I will draw men unto me,''
 Lift Him up! all ye people, lift Him up!

[V2]
 Praise the Lord! praise the Lord!
 Praise His righteousness forever
 Praise the Lord!
 Lift your voices to the sky,
 He said: "If we don't praise His Name
 Then the rocks and stones will cry out",
 Praise the Lord! all ye people,
 Praise the Lord!

[V3]
 Show His love! show His love!
 Show His love to everybody
 Show His love! let your candle always shine,
 He said: that "by the love we show,
 They will know we're His disciples"
 Show His love! all ye people,
 Show His love!
