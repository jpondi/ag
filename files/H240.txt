 Breathe upon us, Lord from heaven,
 Fill us with the Holy Ghost;
 Promise of the Father given,
 Send us now a Pentecost.

[C]
 Breathe upon us, breathe upon us,
 With Thy love our hearts inspire;
 Breathe upon us, breathe upon us,
 Lord, baptize us now with fire.

[V2]
 While the Spirit hovers o'er us,
 Open all our hearts, we pray;
 To Thine image, Lord, restore us,
 Witness in our souls today.

[V3]
 From all sin grant us exemption,
 Wash us in the cleansing blood.
 Let us know the full redemption,
 Purchased for us by the blood.

[V4]
 Lift us, Lord, oh, lift us higher,
 From the carnal mind set free,
 Fill us with refining fire,
 Give us perfect liberty.
