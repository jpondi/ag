 Nobody else could've changed my heart,
 Nobody else could've saved me.
 Picked up the pieces when I fell apart,
 I'm so glad You unchained me.

[C]
 You are the one that I love
 Light of the world sent from above,
 Sing hallelujah! shout to the Lord,
 You are the one, (3)
 You are the one I love.

[V2]
 If I knew the song that the angels sing,
 We'd be singing together.
 I can't wait for eternity,
 Praising Your name forever.
