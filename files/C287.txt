 Where the cloud of God abides, there will I abide;
 When the cloud moves on, it's time to go.
 Where the fire burns, I want to stay;
 This world chills my soul, My bones cry for God's flame.
 Oh! what security, what blissful rest
 What firm assured peace is found
 Neath the fiery pillar of God
 When it moves I move, Where it goes I go.
