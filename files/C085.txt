 He owns the cattle on a thousand hills,
 The wealth in ev'ry mine;
 He owns the rivers and the rocks and rills,
 The sun and stars that shine;
 Wonderful riches more than tongue can tell,
 He is my Father's so they're mine as well;
 He owns the cattle on a thousand hills,
 I know that He will care for me.
