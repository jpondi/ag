 The earth is the Lord's and everything in it,
 The earth is the Lord's, the work of His hands
 The earth is the Lord's and everything in it
 And all things were made for His glory
 The mountains are His, the seas and the islands,
 The cities and towns, the houses and streets,
 Let rebels bow down and worship before Him,
 For all things were made for His glory.
 The earth is the Lord's and everything in it for
 All things were made, yes all things were made
 And all things were made for His glory.
