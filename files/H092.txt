 Who is He in yonder stall,
 At whose feet the shepherds fall?

[C]
 `Tis the Lord! Oh, wondrous story!
 `Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
 At His feet we humbly fall
 Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!

[V2]
 Who is He in deep distress
 Fasting in the wilderness?

[V3]
 Who is He the people bless
 For His words of gentleness?

[V4]
 Who is He to whom they bring
 All the sick and sorrowing?

[V5]
 Who is He that stands and weeps
 At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?

[V6]
 Who is He the gathering throng
 Greet with loud triumphant song?

[V7]
 Lo! at midnight, who is He
 Prays in dark Gethsemane?

[V8]
 Who is He on yonder tree
 Dies in grief and agony?

[V9]
 Who is He who from the grave
 Comes to succour, help, and save?

[V10]
 Who is He who from His throne
 Rules through all the worlds alone?
