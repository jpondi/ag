 Praise Him in the sanctuary
 Praise Him in the mighty Heavens
 Praise Him, all the earth praise Him
 Praise Him in His awesome power
 Praise His great and holy name
 Praise Him, the whole world praise Him
 From the rising of the Sun
 Let His praise be heard
 From the east to the west
 and the north to south
 Let everything that has breath
 Praise the Lord forever
 Let everything in my soul
 Praise the Lord
