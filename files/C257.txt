 There is no one too good,
 There is no one too vile,
 There is no one too great or too small;
 There is no one too wise, And no one too dull,
 His love reaches out to all.

[C]
 He has a welcome for all,
 For all those who seek,
 Guilt He removes,
 And He gives us His love ---
 This He promised to the meek.

[V2]
 One starts early to seek, And another starts late
 To make use of the offer of God;
 There are some who wait till locked is the gate
 Do not wait, O heed to the Lord.
