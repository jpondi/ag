 Ah Lord God,
 Thou hast made the heavens
 And the earth by Thy great power.
 Ah Lord God Thou hast made the heavens
 And the earth by Thine out-stretched arm.
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee,(2)
 O great and mighty God,
 Great in counsel and mighty in deed,

[C]
 Nothing , nothing,
 Absolutely nothing,
 Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
