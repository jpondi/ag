 Away in a manger, No crib for a bed
 The little Lord Jesus Laid down His sweet head,
 The stars in the bright sky Looked down where He lay;
 The little Lord Jesus Asleep on the hay.

[V2]
 The cattle are lowing, The Baby awakes
 But little Lord Jesus, No crying He makes:
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky
 And stay by my side Until morning is nigh.

[V3]
 Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever, And love me, I pray;
 Bless all the dear children In Thy tender care,
 And fit us for heaven To live with Thee there.
