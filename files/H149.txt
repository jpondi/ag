 I have found a deep peace
 That I never had known,
 And a joy this world could not afford,
 Since I yielded control
 Of my body and soul
 To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

[C]
 My wonderful Lord, my wonderful Lord,
 By angels and seraphs in heaven adored!
 I bow at Thy throne, my Saviour divine,
 My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

[V2]
 I desire that my life shall be ordered by Thee,
 That my will be in perfect accord
 With Thine own sovereign will, Thy desires to fulfill,
 My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

[V3]
 All the talents I have
 I have laid at Thy feet,
 Thy approval shall be my reward;
 Be my store great or small, I surrender it all
 To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

[V4]
 Thou art fairer to me than the fairest of earth,
 Thou omnipotent, life-giving Word;
 O Thou Ancient of Days,
 Thou art worthy of praise
 My wonderful, wonderful Lord.
