 Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
 Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
 Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on:
 Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.

[C]
 Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus;
 Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
 Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
 Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!

[V2]
 Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
 Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
 With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear;
 Danger cannot harm me if my Lord is near.

[V3]
 Down in the valley or upon the mountain steep,
 Close beside my Saviour would my soul ever keep;
 He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,
 Up to where they gather on the hills of God.
