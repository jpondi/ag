 Blessed be the fountain of blood,
 To a world of sinners revealed;
 Blessed be the dear Son of God,
 Only by His stripes we are healed.
 Though I've wandered far from His fold,
 Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
 Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
 And I shall be whiter than snow.

[C]
 Whiter than the snow!
 Whiter than the snow!
 Wash me in the blood of the Lamb!
 And I shall be whiter than snow!

[V2]
 Thorny was the crown that He wore
 On the cross, with scoffing and shame;
 Grievous were the sorrows He bore,
 My eternal salvation to gain.
 May I to that fountain be led,
 Opened for my sins here below;
 Wash me in the blood that He shed,
 And I shall be whiter than snow!

[V3]
 Father, I have wandered from Thee,
 Often has my heart gone astray;
 Crimson do my sins seem to me
 Water cannot wash them away.
 Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
 Leaning on Thy promise, I go!
 Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
 And I shall be whiter than snow!
