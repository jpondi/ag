 I've taken my harp down, from the willow tree
 My heart is singing the victory
 My past is forgiven, my home is in Heaven,
 All sorrow is gone, the glory has come
 And now I am free.

[C]
 Thy loving-kindness is better than life (2)
 My lips shall praise Thee
 Thus will I bless Thee
 Thy loving-kindness is better than life.
