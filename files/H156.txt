 Jesus is tenderly calling thee home
 Calling today, calling today!
 Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam,
 Farther and farther away?

[C]
 Call...ing today! call...ing today!
 Je..sus is call...ing, is tenderly
 Calling today!

[V2]
 Jesus is calling the weary to rest
 Calling today, calling today!
 Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest;
 He will not turn thee away.

[V3]
 Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him
 now
 Waiting today, waiting today!
 Come with thy sins; at His feet lowly bow,
 Come, and no longer delay!

[V4]
 Jesus is pleading; oh, list to His voice
 Hear Him today, hear Him today!
 They who believe on His Name shall rejoice;
 Quickly arise and away!
