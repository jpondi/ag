 Lord, may I come and walk with Thee
 How great an honour that will be;
 Never to turn or to look behind
 In step with Thee through all my life.

[C]
 Then let the winds and the storms come,
 I'll feel your strength through all of them;
 Please keep my heart just right with Thee
 Then all will work out right for me.

[V2]
 My focus Lord all of my days,
 Be on your Kingdom and Your ways;
 Fashioned Your instrument to be
 Humbly I'll serve Lord please use me.
