 Send the Light, oh, send it quickly
 For across the heaving main;
 Speed the news of full salvation
 Thro' a dear Redeemer's name.

[C]
 Send the Light, oh, send it quickly
 To the isles beyond the sea;
 Let them hear the wondrous story--
 Love is boundless, grace is free!

[V2]
 Send the Light, where souls are dying
 In their darkness gloom, and night;
 Haste, oh, haste! the days are fleeting,
 And the hours-- how swift their flight!

[V3]
 Send the Light-- the Lord com mands it;
 To His Holy Word attend:
 "Go ye forth and preach My gospel;
 Lo! I'm with you to the end."
