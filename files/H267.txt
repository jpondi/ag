 Blest be the tie that binds
 Our hearts in Christian love;
 The fellowship of kindred minds
 Is like to that above.

[V2]
 Before our Father's throne
 We pour our ardent prayers;
 Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
 Our comforts and our cares.

[V3]
 We share each other's woes,
 Each other's burdens bear;
 And often for each other flows
 The sympathising tear.

[V4]
 When we are called apart
 It gives us inward pain;
 But we shall still be joined in heart,
 And hope to meet again.
