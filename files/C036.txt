 Cause me to come to Thy river O Lord. (3)
 Cause me to come,
 Cause me to drink,
 Cause me to live.

[V2]
 Cause me to come to Thy banqueting hall,
 Cause me to come to Thy table O Lord
 Cause me to come to Thy presence O Lord

[C]
 Cause me to come,
 Cause me to dine,
 Cause me to live.
