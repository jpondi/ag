 Perfect in purity
 Peerless in Thy love
 Boundless in compassion
 My Jesus, how precious Thou art!

[V2]
 Thro' all time and Ages
 There is none like Thee,
 My fainting soul to save
 To give me peace never ceasing.

[V3]
 Jesus Lord most precious
 At Thy Feet I fall
 Fashion me to be
 Perfect and pure, like unto Thee.
