 Lord, the light of Your love is shining,
 In the midst of the darkness, shining;
 Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us,
 Set us free by the truth You now bring us,
 Shine on me, shine on me.

[C]
 Shine, Jesus, shine
 Fill this land with the Father's glory;
 Blaze, Spirit, blaze
 Set our hearts on fire;
 Flow, river flow
 Flood the nations with grace and mercy;
 Send forth Your word,
 Lord, and let there be light.

[V2]
 Lord, I come to Your awesome presence,
 From the shadows into Your radiance;
 By the blood I may enter
 Your brightness,
 Search me, try me, comsume all my darkness,
 Shine on me, shine on me.

[V3]
 As we gaze, on Your kingly brightness,
 So our faces display Your likeness.
 Ever changing from glory to glory,
 Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story,
 Shine on me, shine on me.
