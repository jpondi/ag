Hide me now under Your wings
Cover me within Your mighty hand

    When the oceans rise and
    thunders roar
    I will soar with You above the storm
    Father You are King over the flood
    I will be still and know You are God

Find rest my soul In Christ alone
Know his power In quietness and trust
