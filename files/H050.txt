 Praise Him, Praise Him! Jesus,our blessed Redeemer:
 Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim!
 Hail Him, hail Him highest archangels in glory,
 Strength and honour give to His Holy Name.
[V2]
 Like a Shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
 In His arms He carries them all day long;
 O ye saints that dwell in the mountains of Zion,
 Praise Him, praise Him, ever in joyful song.
[V3]
 
 Praise Him, Praise Him Jesus, our blessed Redeemer:
 For our sins He suffered and bled and died:
 He, our rock, our hope of eternal salvation,
 Hail Him, hail Him, Jesus the Crucified;
[V4]
 Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,
 Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;
 Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken,
 Prince of glory, ever triumphant now.
[V5]
 
 Praise Him, Praise Him Jesus, our blessed Redeemer:
 Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring:
 Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever,
 Crown Him, crown Him, prophet and Priest and King:
[V6]
 Death is vanquished, tell it with joy, ye faithful;
 Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
 Jesus lives, no longer thy portals are cheerless;
 Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.
