1.  Everyone needs compassion
    A love thats never ending
    Let mercy fall on me
    Everyone needs forgiveness
    The kindness of a saviour
    The hope of nations

        Saviour he can move the
        mountains
        My God is mighty to save
        He is mighty to save
        Forever author of salvation
        He rose and conquered the grave
        Jesus conquered the grave

2.  So take me as you find me
    All my fears and failures
    Fill my life again
    I give my life to follow
    Everything I believe in
    Now I surrender

    Shine your light and let the
    whole world see
    Were singing for the glory of the
    risen king
