 There's a peace in my heart
 That the world never gave
 A peace it cannot take away;
 Tho' the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
 I've a peace that has come there to stay

[C]
 Constantly abiding Jesus is mine;
 Constantly abiding Rapture divine
 He never leaves me lonely
 Whispers O so kind,
 "I will never leave thee!" Jesus is mine.

[V2]
 All the world seemed to sing of a Saviour and King
 When peace sweetly came to my heart;
 Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day
 Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

[V3]
 This treasure I have in a temple of clay
 While here on His footstool I roam;
 But He's coming to take me, some glorious day,
 Over there to my heavenly home!
