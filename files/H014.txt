 Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,
 In every part with praise,
 That my whole being may proclaim
 Thy being and Thy ways.

[V2]
 Not for the lip of praise alone,
 Nor e'en the praising heart,
 I ask, but for a life made up
 Of praise in every part.

[V3]
 Praise in the common things of life,
 Its goings out and in;
 Praise in each duty and each deed,
 However small and mean.

[V4]
 Fill every part of me with praise:
 Let all my being speak
 Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
 Poor though I be and weak.

[V5]
 So shalt Thou, Lord, from me, e'en me,
 Receive the glory due;
 And so shall I begin on earth
 The song for ever new.

[V6]
 So shall each fear, each fret, each care,
 Be turned into a song;
 And ev'ry winding of the way
 The echo shall prolong.

[V7]
 So shall no part of day or night
 From sacredness be free;
 But all my life, in every step,
 Be fellowship with Thee.
