1.  To the river I am going
    bringing sins I cannot bear
    Come and cleanse me,
    Come forgive me
    Lord I need to meet you there

2.  In these waters, healing mercy
    flows with freedom from despair
    I am going, to that river
    Lord I need to meet you there

    Precious Jesus, I am ready
    to surrender every care
    Take my hand now,
    lead me closer
    Lord I need to meet you there
    
3.  Come and join us, in the river
    Come find life beyond compare
    He is calling, He is waiting
    Jesus longs to meet you there
