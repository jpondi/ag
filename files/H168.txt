 Years I spent in vanity and pride,
 Caring not my Lord was crucified
 Kowing not it was for me He died
 On Calvary.

[C]
 Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
 Pardon there was multiplied to me;
 There my burdened soul found liberty,
 At Calvary.

[V2]
 By God's Word at last my sin I learned
 Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
 Till my guilty soul imploring turned
 To Calvary.

[V3]
 Now I've giv'n to Jesus every thing,
 Now I gladly own Him as my King,
 Now my raptured soul can only sing
 Of Calvary.

[V4]
 Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
 Oh, the grace that bro't it down to man!
 Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
 At Calvary!
