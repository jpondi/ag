 Through all the changing scenes of life,
 In trouble and in joy,
 The praises of my God shall still
 My heart and tongue employ.

[V2]
 Oh, magnify the Lord with me!
 With me exalt His Name;
 When in distress to Him I called,
 He to my rescue came.

[V3]
 The hosts of God encamp around
 The dwellings of the just;
 Deliverance He affords to all
 Who on His succour trust.

[V4]
 Oh, make but trial of His love!
 Experience will decide
 How blest they are, and only they,
 Who in His truth confide.

[V5]
 Fear Him, ye saints; and you will then
 Have nothing else to fear;
 Make you His service your delight,
 Your wants shall be His care.
