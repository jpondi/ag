 I'm gonna set my mind on things above
 Set my mind on Your great love
 I'm gonna think about
 The things You told me to
 Lord I'm gonna set my mind on You.
 Things that are good, honest and true
 All of the wonderful deeds You do
 Things that are right and pure in Your sight
 With all of my might
 I'm gonna set My mind on You.
