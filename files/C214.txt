 Oh the joy of the Lord is in me
 Oh what happiness He brings
 While I'm walking where He leads me
 That's why you often hear me sing.

[C]
 Bless the Name of Jesus
 Praise the Name of Jesus
 Sing unto the King of Israel (2)
 And we sing glory, glory, glory to His name forever,
 Glory, glory, glory to His name.

[V2]
 Oh let's worship Him in the Spirit
 Oh no matter who you are
 He has done such mighty wonders
 That's why this music stirs my heart.
