 Let me come closer to Thee, Lord Jesus,
 Oh, closer day by day;
 Let me lean harder on Thee, Lord Jesus,
 Yes, harder all the way.

[V2]
 Let me show forth Thy beauty, Lord Jesus,
 Like sunshine on the hills;
 Oh, let my lips pour forth Thy sweetness
 In joyous sparkling rills!

[V3]
 Yes, like a fountain, precious Lord Jesus,
 Make me and let me be;
 Keep me and use me daily, Lord Jesus,
 For Thee, for only Thee.

[V4]
 In all my heart and will, O Lord Jesus,
 Be altogether King;
 Make me a loyal subject, Lord Jesus,
 To Thee in everything.

[V5]
 Thirsting and hungering for Thee, Lord Jesus,
 With blessed hunger here,
 Looking for home on Zion's mountain-
 No thirst, no hunger there.
