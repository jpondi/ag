 Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
 Living with Jesus a new life divine:
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

[C]
 Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
 Moment by moment I've life from above;
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

[V2]
 Never a battle with wrong for the right,
 Never a contest that He doth not fight;
 Lifting above us His banner so white--
 Moment by moment I'm kept in His sight.

[V3]
 Never a trial that He is not there,
 Never a burden that He doth not bear,
 Never a sorrow that He doth not share--
 Moment by moment I'm under His care.

[V4]
 Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,
 Never a tear-drop, and never a moan;
 Never a danger but there on the throne
 Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

[V5]
 Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
 Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
 Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
 Jesus, my Saviour, abides with me, still.
