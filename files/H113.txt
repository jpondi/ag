 This is the day the Lord hath made,
 He calls the hours His own;
 Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad,
 And praise surround the throne.

[V2]
 Today He rose and left the dead,
 And Satan's empire fell;
 Today the saints His triumphs spread,
 And all His wonders tell.

[V3]
 Hosanna to the anointed King,
 To David's holy Son!
 Make haste to help us, Lord, and bring
 Salvation from Thy throne.

[V4]
 Blest be the Lord, who comes to men
 With messages of grace;
 Who comes, in God His Father's Name,
 To save our sinful race.

[V5]
 Hosanna in the highest strains
 The church on earth can raise;
 The highest heavens in which He reigns
 Shall give Him nobler praise.
