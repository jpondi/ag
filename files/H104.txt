 There is a fountain filled with blood
 Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
 Lose all their guilty stains.

[V2]
 The dying thief rejoiced to see
 That fountain in his day:
 And there may I, though vile as he,
 Wash all my sins away.

[V3]
 Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
 Shall never lose its power,
 Till all the ransomed church of God
 Be saved, to sin no more.

[V4]
 E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
 Thy flowing wounds supply,
 Redeeming love has been my theme,
 And shall be till I die.

[V5]
 Then in a nobler, sweeter song
 I'll sing Thy power to save,
 When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
 Lies silent in the grave.
