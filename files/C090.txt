 He's still working on me
 To make me what I ought to be ;
 It took Him just a week to make the moon and stars
 The Sun and the Earth and Jupiter and Mars,
 How loving and patient He must be!
[V2]
 He's still working on me!
 In the mirror of His word, reflections that I see
 Make me wonder why He never gave upon me!
 But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray;
 Remember He's the potter I'm the clay.
