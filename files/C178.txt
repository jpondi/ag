 Lift up the Cross above the earth's horizon;
 The Cross...in every village, nation,
 The Cross...lift up the Saviour Jesus
 Jesus the Saviour of the world.

[V2]
 Lift up the Cross, glorious Cross of Jesus
 The Cross...symbol of hope, forgiveness,
 The Cross...life saving Cross of Jesus.
 Jesus the Saviour of the world.

[V3]
 Lift up the Cross, where sin and death were conqured,
 The Cross...where Jesus won the vict'ry,
 The Cross...the empty Cross of Jesus,
 Jesus, the Saviour of the world.
