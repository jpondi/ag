 Unto Thee, Oh Lord, do I lift up my soul (2)

[C]
 Oh, my God, I trust in Thee;
 Let me not be ashamed,
 Let not my enemies triumph over me.

[V2]
 Yea, let none that wait, wait on Thee be ashamed (2)

[V3]
 Show me Thy ways, Thy ways, Oh Lord,
 Teach me Thy paths,Thy paths, Oh Lord.

[V4]
 Remember not the sins, the sins of my youth (2)
