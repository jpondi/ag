 Silent night! Holy night!
 All is calm, all is bright,
 Round yon virgin mother and Child
 Holy infant so tender and mild,
 Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

[V2]
 Silent night! Holy night!
 Shepherds quake at the sight
 Glories stream from heaven afar,
 Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;
 Christ the Saviour is born, Christ the Saviour is born.

[V3]
 Silent night! Holy night!
 Son of God, love's pure light,
 Radiant beams from Thy Holy face
 With the dawn of redeeming grace
 Jesus Lord at Thy birth, Jesus Lord at Thy birth.
