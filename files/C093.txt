 Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy
 Lord God almighty!
 And we lift our hearts before You
 As a token of our love;
 Holy, holy, holy, holy.

 Gracious Father, gracious Father
 We're so blessed to be Your children, gracious Father
 And we lift our hearts before
 You as a token of our love:
 Gracious Father, gracious Father.

 Precious Jesus, precious Jesus
 We're so glad that You've redeemed us, precious Jesus;
 And we lift our hands before You
 As a token of our love,
 Precious Jesus, precious Jesus.
