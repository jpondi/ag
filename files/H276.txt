 I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
 There's no other way but this;
 I shall ne'er get sight of the gates of light,
 If the way of the cross I miss.

[C]
 The way of the cross leads home,
 The way of the cross leads home;
 It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
 The way of the cross leads home.

[V2]
 I must needs go on in the blood sprinkled way,
 The path that the Saviour trod,
 If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
 Where the soul is at home with God.

[V3]
 Then I bid farewell to the way of the world
 To walk in it never more;
 For my Lord says, "Come," and I seek my home
 Where He waits at the open door.
