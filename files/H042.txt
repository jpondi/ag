 O, bless the Lord from the depth of your soul,
 Forget not the good He has done;
 Forgiveth your sins and He maketh you whole
 For Jesus your sin load has borne.

[C]
 Longsuffering and merciful, gracious is He,
 Far more than a father can be;
 He casts all our sins in the depths of the sea;
 Come, worship the everlasting One.

[V2]
 You can surely trust Him in life's darkest hour;
 When everything seems to go wrong:
 For He loved us while we were sinners and foes
 Such love man hath never yet known.

[V3]
 In praising the Lord new life comes to the soul
 New longings till now quite unknown;
 That every one should be a child of the Lord,
 An heir through Christ Jesus the Son.

[V4]
 Through Jesus you will be a member of heaven
 Blessed with the obedience of faith;,
 Receiving the mind of a servant like Christ
 You follow the path of the saints.
