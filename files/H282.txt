 Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,
 Then I know the sins of earth be set on ev'ry hand:
 Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,
 None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.

[C]
 I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
 I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
 O yes! I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
 For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

[V2]
 Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,
 Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand:
 Safe am I within the castle of God's Word retreating,
 Nothing then can reach me `tis Beulah Land.

[V3]
 Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me;
 I am safely sheltered here, protected by God's hand
 Here the sun is always shining,
 Here there's naught can harm me,
 I am safe forever in Beulah Land.

[V4]
 Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,
 Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way He planned:
 Dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of full salvation,
 Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.
