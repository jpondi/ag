 As we come with praise before His majesty,
 We will celebrate with joy and victory
 For the Lord has come and set His people free,
 We are marching on with Him,
 He's our deliverer.

[V2]
 The two edged sword is sharpen'd in our hand
 We come with vengeance to possess our land.
 We bind the kings because of God's right hand
 And carry out the sentence that our God has plann'd.
