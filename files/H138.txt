 Shackled by a heavy burden,
 `Neath a load of guilt and shame
 Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
 And now I am no longer the same.

[C]
 He touched me, O He touched me,
 And O what joy that floods my soul;
 Something happened, and now I know,
 He touched me and made me whole.

[V2]
 Since I met this blessed Saviour,
 Since He cleansed and made me whole,
 I will never cease to praise Him
 I'll shout it while eternity rolls.
