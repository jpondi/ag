1.  A thousand generations (AR24.1)
    Falling down in worship
    To sing the song of ages
    to the Lamb
    And all who've gone before us
    And all who will believe
    Will sing the song of ages
    to the Lamb

        Your name is the highest
        Your name is the greatest
        Your name stands above them all
        All thrones and dominions
        All powers and positions
        Your name stands above them all

            And the angels cry, Holy
            All creation cries, Holy
            You are lifted high, Holy
            Holy forever

2.  If you've been forgiven
    And if you've been redeemed
    Sing the song forever
    to the Lamb
    If you walk in freedom
    And if you bear His name
    Sing the song forever
    to the Lamb
    We'll sing the song forever and amen

            And the angels cry, Holy
            All creation cries, Holy
            You are lifted high, Holy
            Holy forever
            Hear Your people sing, Holy
            To the King of Kings, Holy
            You will always be, Holy
            Holy forever
