Our beloved Father
Please come down and meet us
We are waiting on Your touch

Open up the heavens
Shower down Your presence
We respond to Your great love

We won't be satisfied with
anything ordinary
We won't be satisfied at all

Open up the sky
Fall down like rain
We don't want blessings
We want you

Open up the sky
Fall down like fire
We don't want anything but you

Our beloved Jesus
We just want to see You
In the glory of Your light
Earthly things don't matter
They just fade and shatter
When were touched by love divine
