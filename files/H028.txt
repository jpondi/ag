 Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,
 There they behold Thy mercy-seat:
 Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,
 And every place is hallowed ground.

[V2]
 For Thou, within no walls confined.
 Inhabitest the humble mind
 Such ever bring Thee where they come,
 And going, take Thee to their home.

[V3]
 Great Shepherd of Thy chosen few,
 Thy former mercies here renew:
 Here to our waiting hearts proclaim
 The sweetness of Thy saving Name.

[V4]
 Here may we prove the power of prayer,
 To strengthen faith, and sweeten care;
 To teach our faint desires to rise,
 And bring all heaven before our eyes.

[V5]
 Lord, we are few, but Thou art near,
 Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;
 Oh, rend the heavens, come quickly down,
 And make a thousand hearts Thine own!
