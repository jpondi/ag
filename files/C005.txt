 According to Thy lovingkindness
 Father, Have mercy on my sinful,
 wretched soul;
 Make me to know once more
 Thy joy and gladness,
 Blot out my sin,
 O cleanse and make me whole.

[C]
 I humbly now acknowledge my transgerssion,
 Against Thee only, Father is my sin;
 Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation
 O purify my life, without within.

[V2]
 A contrite heart I offer Thee,
 Dear Father O hide Thy face
 from all my sin,I pray;
 According to Thy tender love and
 mercy,
 O pardon Lord,
 This soul that went astray.
