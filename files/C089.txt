 He's able,He's able, I know He's able
 I know my Lord is able to carry me thru.
 He's able He's able, I know He's able
 I know my Lord is able to carry me thru.
 He healed the broken-hearted and sets the captive free,
 He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see.
 He's able. . .
