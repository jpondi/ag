 I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,
 I'd rather be His than have riches untold;
 I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands,
 I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.

[C]
 Than to be the king of a vast domain
 And be held in sin's dread sway;
 I'd rather have Jesus than anything
 This world affords today.

[V2]
 I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause,
 I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;
 I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,
 I'd rather be true to His holy name.

[V3]
 He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,
 He's sweeter than honey from out of the comb;
 He's all that my hungering spirit needs,
 I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
