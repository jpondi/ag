 Holy Spirit, faithful Guide,
 Ever near the Christian's side,
 Gently lead us by the hand,
 Pilgrims in a desert land.
 Weary souls for e'er rejoice
 While they hear that sweetest voice,
 Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come,
 Follow Me, I'll guide thee home."

[V2]
 Ever present, truest Friend,
 Ever near Thine aid to lend,
 Leave us not to doubt and fear,
 Groping on in darkness drear;
 When the storms are raging sore,
 Hearts grow faint and hopes give o'er,
 Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come,
 Follow Me, I'll guide thee home."

[V3]
 When our days of toil shall cease,
 Waiting still for sweet release,
 Nothing left but heav'n and prayer,
 Wond'ring if our names are there;
 Wading deep the dismal flood,
 Pleading naught but Jesus' blood,
 Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come,
 Follow Me, I'll guide thee home."
