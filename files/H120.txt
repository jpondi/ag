 There's a work for Jesus
 Ready at your hand,
 'Tis a task the Master
 Just for you has planned.
 Haste to do His bidding,
 Yield Him service true;
 There's a work for Jesus
 None but you can do.

[C]
 Work for Jesus, day by day,
 Serve Him ever, falter never, Christ obey.
 Yield Him service, loyal, true:
 There's a work for Jesus none but you can do.

[V2]
 There's a work for Jesus,
 Humble though it be,
 `Tis the very service
 He would ask of thee.
 Go where fields are whitened,
 And the labourers few;
 There's a work for Jesus
 None but you can do.

[V3]
 There's a work for Jesus,
 Precious souls to bring;
 Tell them of His mercies,
 Tell them of your King.
 Faint not, grow not weary,
 He will strength renew;
 There's a work for Jesus
 None but you can do.
