 Chistians awake! Salute the happy morn
 Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;
 Rise to adore the mystery of love,
 Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
 With them the joyful tidings first begun
 Of God Incarnate and the Virgin's Son.

[V2]
 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
 Who heard the angelic herald's voice: "Behold,
 I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth
 To you and all the nations of the earth:
 This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,
 This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord,"

[V3]
 He spake: and straightway the celestial choir
 In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire;
 The praises of redeeming love they sang,
 And heaven's whole orb with hallelujahs rang;
 God's highest glory was their anthem still,
 Peace upon earth, and unto men good will.

[V4]
 To Bethlehem straight the enlightened shepherds ran,
 To see the wonder God had wrought for man;
 And found, with Joseph and the blessed Maid,
 Her Son, the Saviour, in a manger laid;
 Then to their flocks, still praising God, return,
 And their glad hearts with holy rapture burn.

[V5]
 Oh! may we keep and ponder in our mind,
 God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
 Trace we the Babe who hath retrieved our loss,
 From His poor manger to His bitter cross;
 Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
 Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.

[V6]
 Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
 To sing , redeemed a glad triumphal song;
 He that was born upon this joyful day
 Around us all His glory shall display;
 Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
 Eternal praise to heaven's Almighty King.
