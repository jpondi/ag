 Blessed be the Lord,
 a mighty fortress
 Blessed be the Lord,
 My sword and shield
 Blessed be the Lord,
 who reigns victorious
 Blessed be, Blessed be,
 the name of the Lord.

[V1]
 Your power is like the raging sea,
 Your grace brought it down to me
 And now I walk in victory,
 Blessed be the name of the Lord.

[V2]
 Your blood set the captive free,
 Your love is giving life to me
 And now I'm Yours eternally,
 Blessed be the name of the Lord.
