 Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
 And publish abroad His wonderful Name;
 The Name all-victorious of Jesus extol;
 His kingdom is glorious, and rules over all.

[V2]
 God ruleth on high, Almighty to save;
 And still He is nigh, His presence we have!
 The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
 Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.

[V3]
 Let children acclaim their Saviour and Friend,
 In songs to His Name their praises ascend:
 In such a salvation how great is their joy;
 In true adoration how blest their employ!

[V4]
 Salvation to God, who sits on the throne;
 Let all cry aloud, and honour the Son;
 The praises of Jesus all angels proclaim,
 Fall down on their faces, and worship the Lamb.

[V5]
 Then let us adore and give Him His right,
 All glory and power, all wisdom and might,
 All honour and blessing, with angels above,
 And thanks never-ceasing, and infinite love.
