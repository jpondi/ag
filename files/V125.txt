Big man standing by the blue water side
Mending nets by the blue sea
Along came Jesus, He said :
"Simon Peter, won't you leave
Your nets and come follow me.
You don't need anything,
I've got everything
But Peter, its gonna be a hard way
You don't have to worry now,
Come on and hurry now
I'll walk beside you every day". 
Life wasn't easy for the big fisherman
But still he followed till his dying day
Along came Jesus, He said: Simon Peter,
There's a place in Heaven where you can stay.
