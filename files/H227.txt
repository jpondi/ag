 Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
 Much we need Thy tender care;
 In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
 For our use Thy fold prepare:
 Blessed Jesus,
 Thou hast bought us, Thine we are.

[V2]
 We are Thine, do Thou befriend us;
 Be the guardian of our way:
 Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
 Seek us when we go astray:
 Blessed Jesus,
 Hear Thy children when they pray.

[V3]
 Thou hast promised to receive us,
 Poor and sinful though we be;
 Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
 Grace to cleanse, and power to free:
 Blessed Jesus,
 Let us early turn to thee.

[V4]
 Early let us seek Thy favour,
 Early let us do Thy will;
 Blessed Lord and only Saviour,
 With Thyself our bosoms fill:
 Blessed Jesus,
 Thou hast loved us, love us still.
